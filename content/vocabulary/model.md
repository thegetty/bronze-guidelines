The creation of a {% def "bronze" %} may involve a series of {% def "models" %} and {% def "molds" %} that can differ in size and material depending on the artist’s design process, and ultimately also on the casting process chosen to create the bronze version. The model is a positive version of the sculpture (as opposed to the negative mold); the word may refer to any work made as a step in the preparation of a finished sculpture, at any stage. An existing artwork or a live subject may also serve as model for a bronze. See I.1.

Note: When used in reference to general sculptural practice, the term may refer to a rough sketch made in order to work out the composition (*bozzetto*, *modello*, *esquisse*, or *maquette*) or to a more complete model (“presentation model”), sometimes used to obtain approval from a patron or as a record or reference. Because a {% def "cast (n.)" "cast" %} may be the outcome of numerous steps of models and molds, it may be best to refer to the closest model of a cast as “precursor model” (e.g., the wax model melted out of the {% def "investment" %} to create a particular lost-wax cast) since it can be difficult to identify the relationship of a bronze cast to the earliest model in its genealogy. “Precursor model” is a term newly proposed here.

## Translations {.is-screen-only}

<div class="accordion">
{% include "translation-headings.liquid" %}

{% accordion french "fr" %}

Terme générique désignant ici toute réalisation intervenant dans la fabrication d’une sculpture en bronze. Celle-ci peut mobiliser un grand nombre de modèles (et {% def "moule" "moules" %}) successifs (modèle original, {% def "épreuve d’édition" "réplique" %}, épreuve en cire, etc.).

{% backmatter %}

Note: Le sens donné à modèle est ici plus large que l’« œuvre destinée à être reproduite » ({% cite "Baudry and Bozo 1978" %}, 624), et différent du modèle au sens de l’histoire de l’art qui peut revêtir une grande variété de formes (dessin, esquisse, maquette, etc.).

#### Alternate Translations

- *forma*

    Can refer to both the model and the mold, which leads to potential confusion

- *forma da gittar di bronzo*

    This is the wax model that is used for casting, thus also possibly referring to the {% def "inter-model" %}.
