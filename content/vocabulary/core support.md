definition: A general term for a variety of metal or other features that reinforce or support the core during the casting process. This term is used in different ways depending on the context. In industry, it is applied to metal inserts or spacers that hold the core in place during the pour; therefore, %%core pins%%, %%chaplets%%, and %%mold extensions%% are examples of core supports. In cultural contexts, the term is applied to internal wires or rods that help strengthen the core during assembly of the casting model and/or during the pour. Generally reserved for smaller wires in projecting limbs, or wires and rods used to strengthen joints between separately molded wax sections in the indirect lost-wax process. For clarity, when the second definition is intended, the term “internal core support” should be used.
