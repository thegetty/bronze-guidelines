definition: A bronze cast that has been created from a reusable mold taken directly from an existing bronze. After-casts are therefore made using the indirect lost-wax process, or in some instances by sand casting.

<div class="backmatter">

Note: An after-cast will usually replicate surface traces of alterations on its precursor model, including damage and repairs. It will also tend to be smaller and potentially less crisp than the bronze from which it was derived (see [II.3](#II.3)).
