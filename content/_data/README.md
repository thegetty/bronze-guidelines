## Global Data

Files in the configured data directory will be combined into a single object, for example:

```javascript
{
  config: {},
  eleventyComputed: {},
  figures: {
    figure_list: []
  },
  mapdata: {},
  objects: {
    object_display_order: [],
    object_list: []
  },
  publication: {},
  references: {
    entries: []
  }
}
```
