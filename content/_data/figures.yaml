    caption: "Diagram of generations of casts (here through the lost-wax process): a) the original model here is in clay, but could be made of any material; b) the translation of the original model into a wax inter-model may involve more than simple molding; c) a close reproduction of the original model will be referred to as a replica (a wax inter-model that is altered in details and with additional features [e.g., a base] will result in a %%variant%%); d) more alterations can be made after casting (e.g., with a base or a different patina); e) a bronze can in turn serve as model for another generation of casts by taking a mold of it; f) because wax shrinks as it cools, the inter-models are slightly smaller than the bronze model and their details softer unless reworked; g) the bronze after-cast may be in turn be reworked and finished differently than its original bronze model or sister casts."

    caption: "Graph showing the impact of a lost-wax sculpture’s size on the time needed for the different steps in the fabrication process. The data is based on records gathered between 1973 and 2006 kindly provided by Jean Dubos, director of Fonderie de Coubertin, and are based on the casting of a standing nude man, whatever the model. The duration is given in person-hours and only factors in working hours; the time needed for drying and baking of the investment, for instance, is not taken into account here, although those steps can take a long time (as shown in [table 1](/tables/#table-01)). Also, the more people working simultaneously on a bronze, the quicker the completion (again see [table 1](/tables/#table-01))."

The casting has just been broken out of the mold with dark fire-skin and some of the investment bonded to the surface. Great care in the application of the first investment layers on the wax model resulted in a cleaner as-cast surface with little or no granular texture and minimal investment bonded to the surface, necessitating minimal chasing.

    caption: "Diagram depicting a version of the main steps in sand casting: 1) a chef-modèle or pattern is a specially designed model for sand casting made of a hard material—often metal—to withstand the repeated handling and ramming of sand within a multipart, stacked metal or wooden frame called a casting flask; 2) the pattern is buried about halfway in backing sand in a first section of the flask called the cope; piece mold sections are built up over the model with carefully rammed special casting sand that contains a binder to help the compacted sand hold the desired shape; 3) once the exposed part of the pattern is covered with mold pieces, the second section of the flask, or “drag,” is affixed to the cope and the piece-molded side is back filled with carefully rammed sand; 4) the tightly packed flask is flipped; the cope and backing sand, now on top, are removed to provide access for a similar piece-molding process to be performed on the other side of the chef-modèle; 5) the two-part casting flask is parted and the mold pieces carefully disassembled to remove the pattern; 6) to make a hollow cast, a core must be created to define the thickness of the bronze walls; this is made by ramming the same special casting sand into the hollow impression left by the chef-modèle; metal core supports (the crossed features in black) extending out into the surrounding mold pieces are incorporated into the new sand; the cope and drag are joined, thereby creating a sand replica; 7) the flask is opened again and the sand replica is removed and shaved down evenly overall to form the core; white areas indicate hollow spaces for metal to fill; the thin legs in this case will be solid, and so will not need a core (in [Case Study 6](#CaseStudy6), the core supports were metal tubes that served as core vents as well); 8) the sand mold and core are baked, then carefully reassembled in the cope and drag; the core supports projecting from the core serve to suspend the core in place; channels are cut strategically into the mold to ensure the efficient distribution and flow of the metal and venting of air; 9) the cope and drag are reassembled and locked together, and the metal alloy, which has in the meantime been liquefied, is poured into the mold; 10) once the metal has solidified and cooled, the sand mold is broken open and the bronze cast removed; the metal sprues that have formed in the channels are cut off; and the surface is cleaned and repaired as needed; 11) the bronze surface may be reﬁnished with details before joining the separately cast arms and base. As a final step, a patina may be applied. Diagram based on Charles Marion Russell (American, 1864–1926), *Medicine Whip*, modeled 1911, sand cast 1912–16, H. 14.8 cm (Gilcrease Museum, Tulsa, 0837.14). See [Case Study 6](#CaseStudy6)."

They show the relatively even thickness of metal wall that follows the contours of the molding. The frontal view shows the drips that formed in the neck (turquoise overlay) on the internal surface when the excess liquefied wax was poured out of the reusable mold. The solid spheres on the top of this and the other casts are from air bubbles trapped along the inner surface when the fresh plaster-based core slurry was poured into the mold (orange overlay dots). 2) Unlike the head in 1a, this cast of the Apollo head is more uneven, as seen in particular in the facial area, where the flattened shape of the inner surface is the result of a rather thick clay slab (the “lasagna”) that was initially laid into the reusable mold to create the negative space to be filled by the bronze. 3) The frontal view of the third experimental cast shows the overall even thickness of the metal wall that results from the use of the thin wax slabs pressed into the mold. The joint of several of the wax slabs runs vertically down the face and back of the head (blue overlay lines). See also [fig. 121](/visual-atlas/#fig-121){target=_blank}. The height of the casts is 18 cm (two-thirds of the original size).

In pure copper, Cu atoms are aligned in a face-centered cube: this is the alpha (α) phase (see [fig. 139](/visual-atlas/#fig-139){target=_blank}). The delta (δ) phase forms when there is more than ~20 wt% tin. This face-centered cubic phase is responsible for the specific acoustic properties of bells. The diagram also indicates melting temperatures depending on the alloy composition. For example, an alloy with 10% tin melts fully at ~1000°C, once the liquidus line is passed, as shown by the red dotted lines. It solidifies fully at ~830°C, once the solidus line is crossed."

The radiocarbon determination is represented, along with its uncertainty, as the red curve along the vertical axis; the narrower the curve, the more precise was the instrumental measurement. The blue band represents the IntCal20 calibration curve, which accounts for minor variability in carbon-14 concentration in the atmosphere over time (see {Reimer et al. 2020}). The gray curves along the horizontal axis (calibrated date) represent the probability that the sample actually originated at any given time; the higher the curve, the greater the probability that the date below is correct. The brackets below the gray curves show the time period that is 95.4% certain to contain the true age. Depending on the precision of the measurement and the shape of the calibration curve, a radiocarbon analysis can yield results of varying precision, and can even yield results with more than one possible date range."

To start, Lacey simultaneously heats the bronze relief while gradually applying a solution of potassium polysulfide to create a dark-black background color on the bronze. Next, a layer of ferric nitrate serves to build a brown undertone. This is followed by a green textured layer by stippling copper nitrate solution over the surface at a slightly lower temperature. The final image shows the relief with two different finishes—the left-hand side had hot wax applied to the surface, while the right-hand side was waxed cold—demonstrating how the type of wax application at the final stage can radically alter the appearance of a patina."
