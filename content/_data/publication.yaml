    Since the fourth millennium BCE, bronze has been the preferred medium for some of the most prestigious and sacred works of art. But only through interdisciplinary research can the fabrication of these extraordinary objects be properly investigated, interpreted, and documented. This innovative publication bridges the expertise of myriad art-technological specialists to create a new framework for advancing the understanding of bronze sculpture.

    Essential reading for curators, conservators, scientists, archaeologists, sculptors, metallurgists, founders, dealers, collectors, and anyone interested in the life cycle of a bronze, this volume explains how to identify the evidence of process steps, metals used, casting defects, and surface work and alterations before moving on to address analytical techniques ranging from visual exams to imaging, material analyses, and dating. The guidelines are accompanied by detailed illustrations, including videos, charts, and animations; a robust vocabulary, ensuring precision across English, German, French, Italian, and Chinese; a diverse selection of case studies; and a comprehensive bibliography.

    first_name: Andrew
    last_name: Lacey
    bio: "Andrew Lacey (Artist, Founder, and Independent Scholar) studied archaeometallurgy at the Institute of Archaeology, University College London (MSc. 1998) focusing on interview techniques for gaining insight into the working practices of London fine art foundries. His work as a contemporary artist is highly experimental; casting all his own work in bronze enables creative interception in all stages of the process, further developing visual and material symbologies that are embodied within the sculpture. His work as an independent scholar is a creative collaboration among conservators, historians, makers, and curators, and explores possibilities of hypothetical facture via processes of experimental reconstruction."
