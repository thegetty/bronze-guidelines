    Since the fourth millennium BCE, bronze has been the preferred medium for some of the most prestigious and sacred works of art. But only through interdisciplinary research can the fabrication of these extraordinary objects be properly investigated, interpreted, and documented. This innovative publication bridges the expertise of myriad art-technological specialists to create a new framework for advancing the understanding of bronze sculpture.

    Essential reading for curators, conservators, scientists, archaeologists, sculptors, metallurgists, founders, dealers, collectors, and anyone interested in the life cycle of a bronze, this volume explains how to identify the evidence of process steps, metals used, casting defects, and surface work and alterations before moving on to address analytical techniques ranging from visual exams to imaging, material analyses, and dating. The guidelines are accompanied by detailed illustrations, including videos, charts, and animations; a robust vocabulary, ensuring precision across English, German, French, Italian, and Chinese; a diverse selection of case studies; and a comprehensive bibliography.

    bio: "David Bourgarit (Archaeometallurgist, Centre de Recherche et de Restauration des Musées de France [C2RMF], Paris, and Laboratory TEMPS-CNRS-Nanterre University) has a background in physics, with a PhD on the physical metallurgy of a specific titanium alloy. Since 1996 he has been a researcher at the C2RMF, where he has been investigating metallic artifacts from almost all periods and regions. His primary research interests are in the technological approach to copper metallurgy, with a focus on the provenance of copper and fabrication techniques. He coedited *French Bronze Sculpture: Materials and Techniques 16th–18th Century* (2014)."

A conservator at the Getty Museum since 1991, she has co-curated many exhibitions focused on sculptural processes, including *La Roldana’s St. Ginés: The Making of a Polychrome Sculpture*; *Bernini and Marble* and *Foundry to Finish* on the direct lost-wax casting process. She authored *The Artist Revealed: Adriaen de Vries, Sculptor in Bronze* (2008) and coedited *French Bronze Sculpture: Materials and Techniques 16th–18th Century* (2014)."

Bewer (Research Curator for Conservation and Technical Studies Programs, Harvard Art Museums, Cambridge, Massachusetts), undertook her graduate theses at the Warburg Institute, University of London (MPhil 1986) and the Institute of Archaeology, University College London (PhD 1996), focusing on Renaissance bronze technology. She has published widely on art technology and conservation history. She authored *A Laboratory for Art: Harvard’s Fogg Museum and the Emergence of Conservation in America (ca. 1900–1950)* (2010) and coedited *French Bronze Sculpture: Materials and Techniques 16th–18th Century* (2014) and *The Explicit Material: Inquiries on the Intersection of Curatorial and Conservation Cultures* (2019)."

    bio: "Arlen Heginbotham (Conservator of Decorative Arts and Sculpture, J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles) received his AB in East Asian studies from Stanford University, his MA in art conservation from Buffalo State College, and his PhD in earth sciences from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. His research interests include the use of X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy as a tool for studying copper alloy artifacts, microscopic and chemical wood identification, X-radiographic dendrochronology, and the technical study of Asian export lacquer. He coauthored, with Gillian Wilson, the exhibition catalogue *French Rococo Ébénisterie in the J. Paul Getty Museum* (2021)."

    first_name: Andrew
    last_name: Lacey
    bio: "Andrew Lacey (Artist, Founder, and Independent Scholar) studied archaeometallurgy at the Institute of Archaeology, University College London (MSc. 1998) focusing on interview techniques for gaining insight into the working practices of London fine art foundries. His work as a contemporary artist is highly experimental; casting all his own work in bronze enables creative interception in all stages of the process, further developing visual and material symbologies that are embodied within the sculpture. His work as an independent scholar is a creative collaboration among conservators, historians, makers, and curators, and explores possibilities of hypothetical facture via processes of experimental reconstruction."

    last_name: Motture
    bio: "Peta Motture (Senior Curator, Sculpture, Victoria and Albert Museum, London) joined the V&A in 1985 and since 1990 has specialized primarily in Renaissance sculpture, with a focus on Italy. She has published widely on medieval and later sculpture, notably bronzes, often collaborating with colleagues in the technical study of sculpture. Her books include the *V&A Catalogue of Italian Bells and Mortars* (2001), *Large Bronzes in the Renaissance* (2003), and *The Culture of Bronze: Making and Meaning in Italian Renaissance Sculpture* (2019)."
