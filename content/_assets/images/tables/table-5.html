  Refer to <a href="/_assets/images/tables/table-10/">tables 10</a> and <a href="/_assets/images/tables/table-13/">13</a> and the relevant chapters in volume II for the signification of acronyms, and advantages and limitations of each examination and analytical technique. For each process step, there are numerous risks of misidentification/misinterpretation, so refer to the relevant chapters for more details.<br></br>
