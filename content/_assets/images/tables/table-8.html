  <strong>Common names used to describe copper alloys for bronze sculpture</strong><br />
  <span class="details">As determined by eighteen CAST:ING group members, who include specialists in a wide range of disciplines and fields. Their agreement or disagreement on nomenclature is reported through the percentage of people using a given name. The preferred names of the author are reported in the gray cells. Arsenical bronzes, aluminum bronzes, and more exotic alloys such as copper-antimony, cupro-nickel, and tumbaga are not reported since they are rarely if ever used in bronze sculpture. For exotic prehistoric and historic copper alloys, see {Northover 1998}. The author wishes to recognize the contributors to this table, namely J. Bassett, A. Boulton, M. Castelle, P. Dandridge, L. Garenne-Marot, J. Kreutner, A. Lacey, S. La Niece, E. Lebon, B. Mille, L. Morigi, P. Motture, D. Reid, D. Robcis, D. Strahan, S. Sturman, and J.-M. Welter.</span>
