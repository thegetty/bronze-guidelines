  thickness<br>

  and gold implements embedded in a lead sealing, core material</td>

    . some objects may need to be quarantined for decontamination
  (de-activation), that is, kept at the neutron facility for anywhere between
  several minutes to several days before returning to their owner. The
  quarantine depends on a number of parameters, including neutron flux and
  energy, alloy composition, etc., which can create temporary radioactivity of
  the material. Copper alloys are actually less impacted (unless they contain
  large amounts of gold or arsenic). For example, no quarantine was needed for
  the Javanese statuettes in <a target="_blank" href="/case-studies/4/">Case Study 4</a>.</td>

  variation;<br>

    . private companies may carry out US testing for relatively low cost</td>
  <td>.
  the measurement of wall thickness by US may be altered by any kind of
  perturbation in the metal wall (porosity, crack, large inclusion, etc.). The
  latter may echo the signal and may be confused with the internal surface.
  Calibration is mandatory. A skilled operator is needed<br>
    . US testing is slightly invasive: need for a binding medium between the
  bronze surface and the detector of the instrument, typically a gel (water)</td>
