  <caption><strong>Table 4</strong><br /><strong>Physical characteristics relating to different casting processes observable on a bronze sculpture</strong><br />
  <span class="details">For more details on casting processes please refer to the General Introduction(<a target="_blank" href="/intro/#S2">§2</a>). Warning: It is essential to read the full details in the text (<a target="_blank" href="/vol-1/1/">I.1</a>) to avoid any confusion. Whereas the presence of a particular feature can rule out a particular process, the reverse is not true. For instance, the absence of a fingerprint on a cast does not discount the lost-wax process as the method of facture. Further, the features mentioned here are the most common ones encountered for a given process carried out under “normal” conditions, but any accident may imply diversion from the usual process and generate unexpected features. If, for example, in a direct lost-wax process some of the core has to be reworked in order to adjust the inner thickness of the wax before pouring the bronze, small spherical globules and/or fingerprints may appear on the internal surface of the finished bronze.</span>
