Diagram depicting a version of the direct lost-wax casting technique: 1) an armature is constructed of iron rods and wires; 2) a refractory clay investment is built up over the armature to form the core; 3) a wax layer is then modeled over the core and details refined in order to create a unique wax model; 4) the wax sprue system is joined to the model and core pins inserted through the wax and into the core; 5) the wax is invested in a refractory mold; 6) the mold is heated until dry and all traces of wax are melted and burned out; 7) the mold is filled with molten bronze; 8) when the metal is cool, the investment, core pins, and sprue system are removed; 9) chasing includes polishing, burnishing, and the addition of texture and sharpening of details as needed. As a final step, the surface is patinated. Diagram based on X-radiographs of Adriaen de Vries (Netherlandish, 1556â€“1626), *Juggling Man*, ca. 1615, H. 76.8 cm (J. Paul Getty Museum, inv. 90.SB.44).
