Diagram depicting a version of the direct lost-wax casting technique: 

{% ref fig='fig-013' text='1)' region='280,160,1310,2710' %} an armature is constructed of iron rods and wires; 

{% ref fig='fig-013' text='2)' region='1730,160,1310,2710' %} a refractory clay investment is built up over the armature to form the core; 

{% ref fig='fig-013' text='3)' region='3130,160,1420,2710' %} a wax layer is then modeled over the core and details refined in order to create a unique wax model; 

{% ref fig='fig-013' text='4)' region='4480,180,1660,2710' %} the wax sprue system is joined to the model and core pins inserted through the wax and into the core; 

{% ref fig='fig-013' text='5)' region='5980,160,2120,2710' %} the wax is invested in a refractory mold; 

{% ref fig='fig-013' text='6)' region='0,3390,2050,3300' %} the mold is heated until dry and all traces of wax are melted and burned out; 

{% ref fig='fig-013' text='7)' region='1920,3040,2180,3650' %} the mold is filled with molten bronze; 

{% ref fig='fig-013' text='8)' region='3980,3390,2240,3300' %} when the metal is cool, the investment, core pins, and sprue system are removed; 

{% ref fig='fig-013' text='9)' region='6220,3390,1540,3300' %} chasing includes polishing, burnishing, and the addition of texture and sharpening of details as needed. As a final step, the surface is patinated.
