Because of the thickness of the metal wall and the relatively high density of the leaded copper alloy, high energy (400kV, 4mA) and a thick filter (10 mm copper) were necessary for X-radiography. The other operating conditions were: 10 min. exposure, 3 m source-to-object distance, MX125PB film. *Eros and Psyché*, Roman, 1st century BCE–1st century CE, H. 72 cm (Musée du Louvre, inv.
