Head of a polychrome stone sculpture (calcareous) in visible-light photography and in X-radiography. The blurring of the radiograph is due to X-ray scattering generated by the object itself. *King Childebert*, Abbaye Saint Germain des Prés, Paris, 1239–44, total H. 1.9 m (Musée du Louvre, inv. ML 93).
