This small pair of human figures were modeled directly in wax. The heads were fashioned out of flattened balls of soft wax from which the noses were pinched out into thin, vertical ridges. The breasts are small, flattened balls of wax pressed onto the torsos. The base was formed by the remains of the metal that puddled at the bottom of the casting cup—evidence that the group was cast head-down in the mold. The figures could thus essentially be seen as decorated sprues. *Group of Two Human Figures*, Syro-Hittite, 15th–13th century BCE, H. 7.4 cm (Harvard Art Museums / Arthur M. Sackler Museum, gift of Benjamin and Lilian Hertzberg, 2004.205). See {% cite 'Lie and Bewer 2014' %}, 46.
