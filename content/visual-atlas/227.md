The drapery of the bronze arm was cast in sections and assembled using a flow fusion weld (pink overlay) that is only visible from the interior. The welding appears as a chain of oval shapes. The arm was then joined to the drapery by welding (green overlay) with securing pins (blue overlay). Arm of a statue found in the Villa of Arconciel, Switzerland, end of the 1st–3rd century CE, over life size (Service Archéologique de l’Etat de Fribourg, Switzerland, inv. Arconciel/Es-Nés FR 85).
