Top left: plasticine (black) is used to mark the sections of the piece mold on the resin head (yellow). Top middle and right: plaster is applied to the model in sections. Bottom left: the completed piece mold. Bottom middle: the separate sections of the mold are separated. Wax or clay will be applied on the internal surface by different methods (slabs, painting, balls, see [figs. 17](/visual-atlas/#fig-017){target=_blank}, [19](/visual-atlas/#fig-019){target=_blank}, [24](/visual-atlas/#fig-024){target=_blank}). Bottom right: the reassembled piece mold is used for slush molding. The height is 18 cm (two-thirds of the original size).
