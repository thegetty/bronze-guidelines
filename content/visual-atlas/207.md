Detail of horse’s leg showing the location of the joint made by interlock casting (left). The joint mechanism is visualized in the diagram (right). The separately cast leg and body were assembled using a series of localized bronze pours (teal overlay). Iron shims (red overlay) and core material packed around the internal iron armature were used to contain each section of that pour. The joint was further secured by interlock casting, which entailed creating small openings on either side of the joint (teal squares) for the metal to key into.
