Raised seam lines appear to correspond to traces of the piece mold used to create a plaster model that was then used to cast the bronze using the indirect lost-wax process. Camille Claudel (French, 1864–1943), *Torso of a Crouching Woman*, model ca. 1884–85, cast by 1913, H. 35 cm (J. Paul Getty Museum, inv. 2018.32).
