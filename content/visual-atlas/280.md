Detail from the handle that takes the form of the animal’s tail whose as-cast details have been aggressively reinforced with a V-shaped graver. With each strike of the graver, the tool jumps, creating the visible steps within the engraved line. *Griffin Aquamanile*, Nuremberg, Germany, 1425–50, H. 32 cm (Metropolitan Museum of Art, Robert Lehman Collection, 1975, inv. 1975.1.1413).
