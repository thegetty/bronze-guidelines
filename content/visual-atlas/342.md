Digital photomicrograph showing areas of preserved silver wire and of a larger silver-plate inlay in hammered brass that has been chased to draw the face (right). Some of the silver has been lost, revealing the champlevé preparation for the larger silver-plate inlay (white overlay at center and left). A number of the chased lines would also have been inlaid with silver wire. *Ewer*, Afghanistan (Herat), ca. 1200, H. 39 cm (Musée du Louvre, inv. OA 5548). See %%Collinet 2021%%.
