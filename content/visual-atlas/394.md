X-radiograph of a bronze hare or aardvark. Due to the relative thinness of the bronze walls (<2 mm), relatively low voltage (250 kV) proved sufficient for X-radiography. Other operating conditions (C2RMF): 2mA, 6 min. exposure, 2 m source-to-object distance, 4 mm copper filtering, M100PB film. *Bronze Hare or Aardvark*, Egypt, 11th century CE, L. 63 cm (MusÃ©e du Louvre, inv. OA 6675).
