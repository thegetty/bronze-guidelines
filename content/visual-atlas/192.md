Diagram of a simple core pin repair: 1) a ball of excess wax is applied adjacent to a core pin that has been inserted into the wax model (cross section); 2) the bronze is poured and the core pin is removed; 3) the resulting hole is filled by hammering the excess bronze into the void; 4) the metal that fills the hole is chased to match the surrounding surfaces.
