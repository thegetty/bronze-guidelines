Diagram of a simple core pin repair: 

{% ref fig='fig-192' text='1)' region='20,190,550,410' %} a ball of excess wax is applied adjacent to a core pin that has been inserted into the wax model (cross section); 

{% ref fig='fig-192' text='2)' region='540,190,530,410' %} the bronze is poured and the core pin is removed; 

{% ref fig='fig-192' text='3)' region='1020,30,530,570' %} the resulting hole is filled by hammering the excess bronze into the void; 

{% ref fig='fig-192' text='4)' region='1520,190,520,410' %} the metal that fills the hole is chased to match the surrounding surfaces.
