Wax inter-model and bronze copy of *Antinous* (French School) made by Andrew Lacey in 2014. The core extending out of the base will function as a mold extension, tying the core to the investment and reducing the number of core pins needed. In the indirect process, both the wax inter-model and the casting alloy will contribute to the overall shrinkage of the sculpture. This is most noticeable when comparing the original model to the final bronze sculpture. The wax inter-model will shrink by ~2.5–3% in linear dimension and the casting alloy by ~1–1.5%; therefore the final sculpture will shrink by ~4% in total.
