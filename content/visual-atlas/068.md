Remaining foot of a colossal statute. The height of the statue (probably an emperor) is 3.3–3.5 m. While the overall shape was produced using the indirect lost-wax process, the decoration was created by adding wax rods and threads directly to the wax model. Colossal Foot of Clermont-Ferrand, Roman (Gaule), early 2nd century CE, L. 58 cm (Musée de Clermont-Ferrand, Gaule). See {% cite 'Darblade-Audoin and Tavoso 2008' %}.
