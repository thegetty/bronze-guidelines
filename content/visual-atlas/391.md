The influence of geometry on image quality for X-radiography: 1–2) the greater the distance between source and object, the sharper the image; 3–4) the closer the detector to the object, the sharper the image; 5–6) non-rectilinear arrangements can produce geometric distortion of the image; 7–8) the smaller the X-ray source (focal spot), the sharper the image.
