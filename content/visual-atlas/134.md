Synthetic samples of tin bronzes from 1 wt% tin (top left) to 20 wt% tin (bottom right), showing the evolution of color. Bronze plates, 5 Ã— 6 cm, were cast by Frank Willer/LVR-Landesmuseum Bonn as part of the experimental archaeology for a research project on Roman large bronzes (see {Willer, Schwab, and Mirschenz 2017}). The pieces were polished with pumice stone to enable a clearer perception of the actual color of the alloy with as little reflection as possible. Photograph using neutral studio strobes.
