Research indicated that, although brightly polished when acquired (left), this sculpture was intended by the artist to have a thin brown patina. It was therefore allowed to darken by exposure to air for some years (middle). This appearance was still considered unacceptable, so repatination was deemed necessary to return it to its original appearance (right).
