3D model of a punch mark (0.8 mm in diameter) from the lotus of a Buddha Vairocana (see fig. 285). The model was generated by a digital microscope using automated focus stacking. Note the imperfection in the sphere resulting from a defect on the face of the punching tool. *Buddha Vairocana*, Indonesia, first half of the 10th century, H. 12 cm (Musée national des arts asiatiques – Guimet, Paris, inv. MA 3475). See {% cite 'Mechling et al. 2018' %}.
