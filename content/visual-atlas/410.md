The measurements of a sculpture will vary significantly depending on the position one chooses to make them inâ€”choices that are particularly challenging when there is no obvious primary view, or when an object is fragmentary. For the sake of argument, Francesca G. Bewer positioned the rearing horse, flawed with its front legs missing, in several ways and measured the width and length, projecting the farthest points onto gridded paper, to show the variations. The uppermost gridded sketch reflects measurements taken with the horse in alignment with the paper (red lines correspond to the horse upright on its hind legs, the blue ones with it posed on all fours). The bottom two images show measuring done with the horse at an angle, first upright (lines in blue), then lowered (lines in red). The height, of course, will vary in relation to the position. Andrew Lacey (British, b. 1969), equine study demonstration model, 2004, H. 20.3 cm horse upright and 15.5 cm with legs lowered (private collection), cast by the artist in 2004 for experimental purposes at AMTeC (Ancient materials and technologies) Renaissance bronze workshop, Chatham Dockyard, UK.
