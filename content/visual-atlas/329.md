Detail of leg showing darker rectangular repairs. It is likely that the numerous repaired casting flaws were originally intentionally hidden by a dark or opaque coating. These repairs are now visible due to exposure to the weather and loss of original coating. Simon Mazière (French, 1649–1722), *Un Amour tenant un oiseau et deux enfants*, ca. 1685, cast by Aubry, Bonvalet, Schabol, and Taubin 1686–90, H. 161 cm (Water Parterre, Musée National des châteaux de Versailles et de Trianon, France, inv. 1850.8931).
