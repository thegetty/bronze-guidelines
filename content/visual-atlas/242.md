The same punch marks with the same sequential strikes were found on two statues by Benvenuto Cellini (Italian, 1500–1571). The right image from the forehead of the *Bust of Bindo Altoviti*, 1546–50, H. 105.5 cm (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston, inv. S26e21) and the left and middle images from Medusa’s neck on *Perseus with the Head of Medusa*, 1545–54, H. 320 cm (bronze group) (Loggia dei Lanzi, Piazza della Signoria, Florence). Micro-hardness tests were undertaken using a calibrated prism penetration durimeter, showing values very similar to that of a cold-worked copper surface. See [I.6](#I.6), note 17; %%Morigi and Morigi 2004%%.
