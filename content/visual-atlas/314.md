Details of four of the bronze plates from the Vendôme Column showing the influence of metal composition on the patina shade. All plates are made of leaded tin-bronze, except the repairs (zinc and tin-copper alloy). Tin content is steady, and lead controls the color: the higher the lead content, the higher the lead in the corrosion products, and the whiter the patina. In each plate, the different patina layers are revealed by polished cross sections observed under optical microscopy (center images) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM-BSE mode) (right images). The layers are, from bottom to top: metal, red cuprite, outer layer. The composition of the metal (XRF analyses) and of the patina (XRD) is indicated. Various French sculptors, *Vendôme Column*, 1805–10, dismantled 1871, re-erected 1873–75, H. 44 m (Place Vendôme, Paris). See {% cite 'Texier et al. 2016' %}.
