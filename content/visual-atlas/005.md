In-process detail of the second reconstruction by Andrew Lacey (British, b. 1969) of one of the so-called Rothschild Bronzes, attributed to Michelangelo (Italian, 1475â€“1564), H. 91.2 cm (private collection). The casting has just been broken out of the mold with a dark oxide layer and some of the investment bonded to the surface. Great care in the application of the first investment layers on the wax model resulted in a cleaner as-cast surface with little or no granular texture and minimal investment bonded to the surface, necessitating minimal chasing.
