Metallographic investigation of a cross section has shown that the dark-green patina on this bust formed naturally during burial and is of the type referred to as “noble patina” ({Gettens 1970}; {Robbiola and Hurtel 1997}). Heated glass-paste inlay is used to create solid and translucent colors within depressions or elevated chambers. Here, elementary chemical analysis indicates the eyes were produced using luxury glassmaking techniques, including colored glass (%%Descamps-Lequime, Biron, and Langlois 2017%%). *Livia*, Neuilly-le-Réal (Allier, France), 1st century CE, H. 21 cm; head H. 10 cm (Musée du Louvre, inv. Br 28).
