Castability tests devised by the C2RMF were carried out at the Coubertin foundry, France, in 2015. The distance that the molten metal travels in channels of different diameters is used as a measure of its castability. A) Copper and copper alloy rods of specific compositions were melted in preparation for the test; B) hollow channels of different diameters were made in refractory molds using wires of different gauges, and the baked molds were transferred to the furnace; C) the melt temperature was measured prior to pouring; D) the alloy was poured into the molds; E) each mold was weighed post-pour to gauge the quantity of metal; F) each mold was then radiographed at the C2RMF to assess how far the metal had traveled.
