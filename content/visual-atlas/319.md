Bronze sculpture of horse and rider clearly made by a lost-wax casting process. The work exhibits a modern coating; the original surface appearance is unknown (and may never be known) due to repeated surface treatments it experienced after leaving Africa. *Mounted Ruler*, Edo Peoples, Benin, Nigeria, 16th century, L. 45.7 cm (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, inv. L-G 7.12.2012).
