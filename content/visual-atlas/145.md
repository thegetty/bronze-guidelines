Bright field photomicrograph of an etched polished cross section of a repair filling a core-pin hole. The dendritic microstructure shows that the repair was cast on. The large curved dendrites of the alpha phase (yellow to pink) are marked by a strong primary chemical segregation (known as zoning) between the center of the dendrite (pink) and its periphery (yellow). *Colossal Foot of Clermont-Ferrand*, Roman (Gaule), early 2nd century CE, L. 58 cm (Mus√©e de Clermont-Ferrand, France).
