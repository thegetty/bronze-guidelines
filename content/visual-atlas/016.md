Diagram depicting a version of the lost-wax slush-molding process combined with ceramic shell casting: 1) a flexible silicone two-piece mold is created from the model (in this example made of clay); the layer of silicone is backed with a rigid mother mold; 2) this reusable mold is disassembled and the model removed; 3) to form the inter-model, molten wax may first be brushed into the interior of the piece mold to ensure that the wax reaches all areas and captures the fine details; 4) the mold is reassembled; the molten wax is poured in and slushed around in order to coat the interior; 5) excess molten wax is poured out; this “slush molding” is repeated until the desired thickness is achieved; 6) the hollow wax inter-model is removed from the mold, imperfections repaired, and details refinished; 7) core pins are pushed through the wax walls and the wax sprue system is fused to the inter-model; 8) an internal core support (armature) is inserted into the hollow wax, which is then filled with refractory core material (note: in ceramic shell casting, the core can be a plaster-based investment or the same ceramic shell materials as the outer mold); 9) the inter-model is then coated with a liquid ceramic slurry followed by grains of fused ceramic to provide bulk and a textured surface that will ensure that the next layer of slurry adheres well; once this first layer is dry, the process is repeated (eight to ten times) to create the desired thickness of ceramic shell; 10) when the refractory mold has dried, it is placed upside down and heated rapidly to burn out all traces of wax; it is then placed in a kiln to dry the plaster investment core and sinter the ceramic shell into a sturdy, unified body that can withstand the pressure of the molten bronze; 11) the hot mold is removed from the kiln, turned with the casting cup facing up, and the molten bronze poured into the mold; 12) when the metal has cooled, the ceramic shell casing is broken off of the cast and remains are removed by sandblasting; the bronze sprue system is cut off and the core pins and plaster core removed along with the internal armature; 13) chasing includes polishing, burnishing, and the addition of textures and sharpening of details as needed; 14) as a final step, a chemical patina and/or a coating may be applied. Diagram based on Andrew Lacey (British, b. 1969), *The Anatomy of Bronze*, cast by the artist in 2019, Devon, UK, H. 45 cm (artist’s collection). See [Case Study 7](#CaseStudy7).
