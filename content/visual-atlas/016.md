Diagram depicting a version of the lost-wax slush-molding process combined with ceramic shell casting: 

{% ref fig='fig-016' text='1)' region='160,180,1450,1720' %} a flexible silicone two-piece mold is created from the model (in this example made of clay); the layer of silicone is backed with a rigid mother mold; 

{% ref fig='fig-016' text='2)' region='1670,180,1450,1720' %} this reusable mold is disassembled and the model removed; 

{% ref fig='fig-016' text='3)' region='3250,180,1630,1720' %} to form the inter-model, molten wax may first be brushed into the interior of the piece mold to ensure that the wax reaches all areas and captures the fine details; 

{% ref fig='fig-016' text='4)' region='5040,180,1550,1720' %} the mold is reassembled; the molten wax is poured in and slushed around in order to coat the interior; 

{% ref fig='fig-016' text='5)' region='6590,180,1490,1720' %} excess molten wax is poured out; this “slush molding” is repeated until the desired thickness is achieved; 

{% ref fig='fig-016' text='6)' region='160,2220,1450,1720' %} the hollow wax inter-model is removed from the mold, imperfections repaired, and details refinished; 

{% ref fig='fig-016' text='7)' region='1670,2220,1450,1720' %} core pins are pushed through the wax walls and the wax sprue system is fused to the inter-model; 

{% ref fig='fig-016' text='8)' region='3290,2220,1450,1720' %} an internal core support (armature) is inserted into the hollow wax, which is then filled with refractory core material (note: in ceramic shell casting, the core can be a plaster-based investment or the same ceramic shell materials as the outer mold); 

{% ref fig='fig-016' text='9)' region='4880,2220,1600,1720' %} the inter-model is then coated with a liquid ceramic slurry followed by grains of fused ceramic to provide bulk and a textured surface that will ensure that the next layer of slurry adheres well; once this first layer is dry, the process is repeated (eight to ten times) to create the desired thickness of ceramic shell; 

{% ref fig='fig-016' text='10)' region='6610,2220,1470,1720' %} when the refractory mold has dried, it is placed upside down and heated rapidly to burn out all traces of wax; it is then placed in a kiln to dry the plaster investment core and sinter the ceramic shell into a sturdy, unified body that can withstand the pressure of the molten bronze; 

{% ref fig='fig-016' text='11)' region='50,4420,1450,1720' %} the hot mold is removed from the kiln, turned with the casting cup facing up, and the molten bronze poured into the mold; 

{% ref fig='fig-016' text='12)' region='1500,4420,1790,1720' %} when the metal has cooled, the ceramic shell casing is broken off of the cast and remains are removed by sandblasting; the bronze sprue system is cut off and the core pins and plaster core removed along with the internal armature; 

{% ref fig='fig-016' text='13)' region='3290,4420,1520,1720' %} chasing includes polishing, burnishing, and the addition of textures and sharpening of details as needed; 

{% ref fig='fig-016' text='14)' region='5090,4420,1520,1720' %} as a final step, a chemical patina and/or a coating may be applied.
