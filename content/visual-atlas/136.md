Side-by-side view of the Ephesian bronze Athlete, Roman, copy after Greek original, last quarter 4th century BCE, H. 193 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna, Collection of Greek and Roman Antiquities, inv. VI 3168), and the Florentine marble Apoxyomenos, 2nd century CE, H. 193 cm (Gallerie degli Uffizi, Florence, inv. 100). Both appeared the 2015 exhibition *Power and Pathos: Bronze Sculpture of the Hellenistic World*, Palazzo Strozzi, Florence. Although the extension of the limbs is less dramatic than on other statues, the two arms are secured by a strut on the marble statue but not on the bronze.
