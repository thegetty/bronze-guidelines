This slice from a computer tomography (CT) scan captured at the widest area of the neck shows a layer of metal separating the head from the body (see overlay). This is evidence that the head was cast onto an already-cast body by a localized lost-wax process. Excess metal dripped down a hollow channel along the vertical wooden armature in the torso. Elemental mapping by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis revealed that the body is made of a different alloy than the head, confirming that the head was joined to the body at a separate stage. *Seated Brahma*, Cambodia, late 12th or early 13th century, H. 31.5 cm (Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, inv. 54.2734).
