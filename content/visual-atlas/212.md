Gamma radiograph showing Roman joints in the arms of a figure. The type of joint used to attach the separately cast head cannot be determined in this radiograph. Gamma radiography was used due to the lack of available high-kV X-radiography. Thomas Ball (American, 1819â€“1911), *Daniel Webster*, 1853, sand cast probably after 1858, probably by the Ames Manufacturing Company, Chicopee, Massachusetts, H. 75.6 cm (Gilcrease Museum, Tulsa, inv. 0826.93). See [fig. 213](/visual-atlas/213/) for an overall view.
