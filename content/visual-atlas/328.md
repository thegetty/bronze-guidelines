This piece has lived outdoors for more than three centuries as part of the Neptune Fountain at Drottningholm Palace in Sweden. Its natural patina is varied due to different types of exposure. It ranges from an attractive, glossy, warm brown to a more matte and streaky green and black. Adriaen de Vries (Netherlandish, 1556–1626), *Naiad (Ceres)*, 1615–18, H. 142 cm (Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, inv. NMDrh.Sk50). See %%Scholten 1998%%, 218.
