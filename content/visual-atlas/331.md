Core material from inside has migrated to the surface of the chin in this porous bronze during wet years, causing green corrosion. The left image shows it before treatment. After removal of the green corrosion by power washing, the raw pink bronze was revealed because the corrosion had destroyed the brown patina (right). More core material has since migrated (white areas) from the interior. Jo Mora (American, b. Uruguay, 1876â€“1947), *Indian Maiden*, 1928, cast by the California Art Bronze Foundry, Los Angeles, H. 182.8 cm (Woolaroc Museum and Wildlife Preserve, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, inv. SCT-47).
