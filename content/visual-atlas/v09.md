Real-time video of the X-radiography of the pouring of a bronze, showing the path of the molten 10 wt% tin bronze into a refractory mold of a life cast of a lizard. The pour results in shrinkage porosity on the surface of the bronze. It is unlikely to be gaseous porosity, as it was degassed prior to pouring and the holes are very large, with the last one being highly granular in texture, indicating slow cooling. Note also how quickly the mold is filled with bronze (see also [fig. 27](/visual-atlas/027/)).
