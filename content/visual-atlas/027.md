Andrew Laceyâ€™s life-cast of a lizard. Top left: the lizard is sprued in the bottom of the mold. Top right: top part of the plaster refractory mold with the lizard still in. Bottom left: detail of the plaster mold once the lizard was partially removed by burning. Bottom right: detail of the cast bronze. The cast of the lizard was made in a mold designed in parts to remove any remaining bones or ash. Had it not been, some of these remains might have gotten lodged in the metal and formed an inclusion that could result in a lacuna in the cast. See [I.3](/vol-1/3/). Andrew Lacey (British, b. 1969), *Life Cast of a Lizard*, cast by the artist in 2015, Devon, UK, L. 15 cm (Victoria and Albert Museum, inv. NCOL.517-2015).
