Two ways of preparing the two parts to be assembled by flow fusion welding as witnessed on various antique large bronzes. Left side: the base metal is cut away to half its thickness to make a channel through which the molten bronze can run; right side: a space is left between the two parts to be joined and the welding metal is directly poured through this space. See %%Az√©ma et al. 2011%%.
