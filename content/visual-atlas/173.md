The process of setting in a patch to mask a superficial casting flaw: 1) casting flaw noted on the surface of the bronze (cross section); 2) the flaw is chiseled to create a geometric shape that is easily duplicated; an undercutting bevel is cut into the sides of the wall; 3) a metal patch is set into the flaw; 4) the patch is hammered and chased to fill the flaw and match the adjacent surface as much as possible; the repair is locked in place by the undercut of the bevel; 5) a similar process can be used to insert a plug to repair a flaw that extends through the entire thickness of the wall.
