The process of setting in a patch to mask a superficial casting flaw: 

{% ref fig='fig-173' text='1)' region='0,0,1180,400' %} casting flaw noted on the surface of the bronze (cross section); 

{% ref fig='fig-173' text='2)' region='0,400,1180,400' %} the flaw is chiseled to create a geometric shape that is easily duplicated; an undercutting bevel is cut into the sides of the wall; 

{% ref fig='fig-173' text='3)' region='0,800,1180,400' %} a metal patch is set into the flaw; 

{% ref fig='fig-173' text='4)' region='0,1200,1180,400' %} the patch is hammered and chased to fill the flaw and match the adjacent surface as much as possible; the repair is locked in place by the undercut of the bevel; 

{% ref fig='fig-173' text='5)' region='0,1600,1180,400' %} a similar process can be used to insert a plug to repair a flaw that extends through the entire thickness of the wall.
