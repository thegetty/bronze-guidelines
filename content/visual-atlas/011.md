Diagram depicting an example of life-casting: 

{% ref fig='fig-011' text='1)' region='600,260,2060,2320' %} the lizard is placed in a bed of clay; rolls of wax are strategically joined to the lizard to form the sprue system; a clay wall is then built around it; 

{% ref fig='fig-011' text='2)' region='3780,260,2060,2320' %} a plaster-based slurry is poured over the lizard and sprue system, embedding the lizard and sprues, forming the top half of the refractory mold; 

{% ref fig='fig-011' text='3)' region='600,2940,2430,2320' %} when set, the mold is turned over, the bottom clay slab is removed, and new clay walls are built up to contain the other half of the mold and additional refractory material is poured in; 

{% ref fig='fig-011' text='4)' region='3780,2940,1900,2320' %} the mold is heated until dry; the wax and as much of the lizard as possible are burned away; the bone remnants can be removed by opening the mold; 

{% ref fig='fig-011' text='5)' region='600,5600,1680,2320' %} the two sides of the mold are clamped together and filled with molten bronze; 

{% ref fig='fig-011' text='6)' region='2630,5600,1680,2320' %} the refractory mold and sprue system are removed from the cast; 

{% ref fig='fig-011' text='7)' region='4600,5600,1390,2320' %} the finishing of the solid bronze includes sharpening of details as needed and patination.
