Bronze reproduction by slush molding of the head of the *Apollo of Lillebonne* made during the 2016 CAST:ING meeting, Coubertin foundry, France. Despite its complex shape, the cavity on the left cheek does not stem from any exogenous material fallen in the melt, but rather from the thinness of the wax model in this area, which caused air to be trapped, thereby preventing the mold from filling. The vertical seam lines in the middle of the forehead are a direct reproduction of the mold lines on the wax model (see [fig. 74](/visual-atlas/074/)). The height is 18 cm (two-thirds of the original size). Original: *Apollo of Lillebonne*, France, 1st century BCE–1st century CE, H. 193 cm (Musée du Louvre, inv. Br37 [NIII65]). See [fig. 288](/visual-atlas/288/).
