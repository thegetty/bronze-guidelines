Measuring the width and depth of a statuette (viewed from above) by placing it in a virtual box. The gridded support on which the figure rests simplifies the determination of the box’s perpendicular lines. Camille Claudel (French, 1864–1943), *Torso of a Crouching Woman*, model ca. 1884–85, cast by 1913, H. 35 cm (J. Paul Getty Museum, inv. 2018.32).
