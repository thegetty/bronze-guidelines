Overall view and details of the inside of the sculpture showing tool marks that indicate the core has been shaved down. This was done using a coarse-toothed tool, hence the parallel lines (top right). Other singular lines were used either to define the depth that was needed to cut back or to sketch the design or form of the head/features directly onto the core (bottom right). A flat spatula was also used to scrape back the surface of the core (bottom left). Andrew Lacey (British, b. 1969), untitled head, cast by the artist in 2017, H. 31 cm (artistâ€™s collection).
