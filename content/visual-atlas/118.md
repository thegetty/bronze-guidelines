Overall view and details of the work’s inside showing tool marks that indicate the core has been shaved down. This was done using a coarse-toothed tool, hence the parallel lines (top right). Other singular lines were used either to define the depth that was needed to cut back or to sketch directly onto the core the design or form of the head/features (bottom right). A flat spatula was also used to scrape the surface of the core back (bottom left). Andrew Lacey (British, b. 1969), untitled head, cast by the artist in 2017, H. 31 cm (artist’s collection).
