A digital turntable used in conjunction with a simple easel allows multiple 360Â° rotation series to be acquired in identical positions and composited in batches. The detector panel slides to a new position for each rotation.  Because the detector stays in one plane, the image sets can be assembled by simple tiling, without the need for sophisticated alignment algorithms.
