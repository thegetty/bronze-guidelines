Detail of the reverse of a gilded brass relief figure showing gouge marks from the carved, hollow wooden pattern and the granular surface of the sand mold. Because this is a relief, the reverse should be considered the external surface as well. Relief figure of Benjamin Franklin, purportedly cast by Paul Revere (American, ca. 1735–1818) after a wood model by Simon Skillen, from Joseph Pope’s (American, 1750–1826) *Grand Orrery*, 1776–87, H. 31 cm (Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, Harvard University, inv. 0005).
