Diagram depicting a version of the direct wax-slab process: 

{% ref fig='fig-028' text='1)' region='210,190,1740,2000' %} the main shape of the griffin head casting model is formed of wax slabs that are cut into their proper shapes; the raised shapes of the upper and lower eyelids are formed by pressing the slabs out, producing recesses on the reverse; 

{% ref fig='fig-028' text='2)' region='1840,190,1560,2000' %} the wax elements are joined with a heated tool to form a hollow head; 

{% ref fig='fig-028' text='3)' region='3270,190,1550,2000' %} the hollow wax griffin head is filled with a refractory clay core material; the eye cavities are cut out and ledges formed on the interior to support inlays that will later fill the voids; 

{% ref fig='fig-028' text='4)' region='4860,190,1650,2000' %} details are added to the wax; these include incised lines around the eyes and a scaly pattern formed with punches; the solid wax tongue, ears, and top knob are joined to the head; 

{% ref fig='fig-028' text='5)' region='6360,190,1630,2000' %} the sprue system is joined to the model; 

{% ref fig='fig-028' text='6)' region='0,2630,2140,2780' %} the wax model is invested in a refractory mold that is heated until dry and all traces of wax are burned out; the openings in the eyes and the neck act as core extensions, preserving the space between the core and the outer mold; 

{% ref fig='fig-028' text='7)' region='2140,2630,1900,2780' %} the mold is filled with molten bronze; 

{% ref fig='fig-028' text='8)' region='3970,2630,2130,2780' %} when cool, the cast is broken out of the mold, and the sprue system is removed; 

{% ref fig='fig-028' text='9)' region='6160,3410,1630,2000' %} the bronze is then chased and in this example the eyes inlaid. Diagram based on {% cite 'Mattusch 1990' %}.
