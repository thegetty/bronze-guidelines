Diagram depicting a version of the direct wax-slab process: 1) the main shape of the griffin head casting model is formed of wax slabs that are cut into their proper shapes; the raised shapes of the upper and lower eyelids are formed by pressing the slabs out, producing recesses on the reverse; 2) the wax elements are joined with a heated tool to form a hollow head; 3) the hollow wax griffin head is filled with a refractory clay core material; the eye cavities are cut out and ledges formed on the interior to support inlays that will later fill the voids; 4) details are added to the wax; these include incised lines around the eyes and a scaly pattern formed with punches; the solid wax tongue, ears, and top knob are joined to the head; 5) the sprue system is joined to the model; 6) the wax model is invested in a refractory mold that is heated until dry and all traces of wax are burned out; the openings in the eyes and the neck act as core extensions, preserving the space between the core and the outer mold; 7) the mold is filled with molten bronze; 8) when cool, the cast is broken out of the mold, and the sprue system is removed; 9) the bronze is then chased and in this example the eyes inlaid.
