X-radiograph showing a wax-to-wax joint on the right arm (red dotted line), as revealed by the discontinuity in the metal wall thickness (blue overlay). Note that making precise measurements of wall thickness from radiographs may be difficult, as the external edge may not be visible if overexposed (yellow line). As a consequence, the metal wall thickness may be up to 30% greater than that inferred from the radiograph (blue overlay). After Giambologna (Flemish, 1524–1608), *Hercules*, ca. 1580, cast in Italy, Germany, or the Netherlands, 17th century or later, H. 43 cm (Musée des Beaux-Arts d’Angers, France, inv. 2003-1-180).
