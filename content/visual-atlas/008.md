View of the inside of the hollow sculpture that has been partially cleaned out of its core. The cavity preserves some of the iron armature rods and wires as well as remnants of baked bricks that would have been embedded in the clay-based, refractory core mixture (image width ~50 cm). Barthélemy Prieur (French, 1536–1611), *Peace*, cast in 1571 by Nicolas Péron, H. 128 cm (Musée du Louvre, inv. MR1683).
