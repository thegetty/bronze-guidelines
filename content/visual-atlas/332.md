Machine oil was applied in a misguided attempt to spruce this work up, and years later, disfiguring black patches have emerged on the surface of the patina due to interaction with the oil. Alexander Phimister Proctor (American, b. Canada, 1862–1950), *Q-Street Buffalo*, 1912, sand cast in 1912–13 in Brussels at Verbeyst Foundry, H. 33.7 cm (Gilcrease Museum, Tulsa, inv. 08.840).
