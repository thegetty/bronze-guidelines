Diagram of a version of the lasagna technique: 

{% ref fig='fig-023' text='1)' region='190,0,1510,1510' %} a plaster piece mold is built up in sections around the clay model; 

{% ref fig='fig-023' text='2)' region='1950,0,1710,1510' %} the reusable mold is disassembled; 

{% ref fig='fig-023' text='3)' region='3800,0,2030,1510' %} sections of the mold are lined with sheets of clay that Cellini referred to as “lasagna” and that create the space to be filled eventually by bronze; 

{% ref fig='fig-023' text='4)' region='190,1810,1510,1510' %} a fire-resistant clay core is built up around an iron armature to fit snugly into the lasagna-lined mold and then dried; 

{% ref fig='fig-023' text='5)' region='1890,1810,1800,1510' %} the piece mold is disassembled in order to remove the lasagna; 

{% ref fig='fig-023' text='6)' region='3800,1810,1660,1510' %} the core is baked and reinforced by binding with wires; the fired core and plaster piece mold are assembled; the armature and mold extension at the base help to preserve the space created by the lasagna; 

{% ref fig='fig-023' text='7)' region='190,3770,1510,1510' %} molten wax poured into the space between the core and the piece mold creates the inter-model; when freed from the mold it is reworked to the artist’s liking; 

{% ref fig='fig-023' text='8)' region='1950,3770,1510,1510' %} the sprue system is joined to the inter-model and invested with refractory mold material; 

{% ref fig='fig-023' text='9)' region='3760,3770,1590,1510' %} the mold is then heated until dry and all traces of wax are burned out; 

{% ref fig='fig-023' text='10)' region='130,5750,1510,1950' %} molten bronze is poured into the baked mold until it is full; 

{% ref fig='fig-023' text='11)' region='1990,5750,1510,1950' %} when the metal has cooled, the refractory mold is broken away, the armature and core removed, and the sprue system cut off; 

{% ref fig='fig-023' text='12)' region='3800,6190,1590,1510' %} separately cast parts, such as a base, may be added at this stage, and the surface color may be enhanced by various means, including patination or gilding.
