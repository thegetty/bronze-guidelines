Diagram of a version of the lasagna technique. 1) a plaster piece mold is built up in sections around the clay model; 2) the reusable mold is disassembled; 3) sections of the mold are lined with sheets of clay that Cellini referred to as “lasagna” and that create the space to be filled eventually by bronze; 4) a fire-resistant clay core is built up around an iron armature to fit snugly into the lasagna-lined mold and dried; 5) the piece mold is disassembled in order to remove the lasagna; 6) the core is baked and reinforced by binding with wires; the fired core and plaster piece mold are assembled; the armature and mold extension at the base help to preserve the space created by the lasagna; 7) molten wax poured into the space between the core and the piece mold creates the inter-model; when freed from the mold it is reworked to the artist’s liking; 8) the sprue system is joined to the inter-model and invested with refractory mold material; 9) the mold is then heated until dry and all traces of wax are burned out; 10) molten bronze is poured into the baked mold until it is full; 11) when the metal has cooled, the refractory mold is broken away, the armature and core removed, and the sprue system cut off; 12) separately cast parts, such as a base, may be added at this stage, and the surface color may be enhanced by various means, including patination or gilding.
