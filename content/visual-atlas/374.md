The main steps to design a resin model of a sculpture using photogrammetry: 1â€“2) digital photography of the original sculpture is undertaken at many angles to cover the whole object; 3) a digital model made of a dense cloud of points is made via reconstruction software; 4) the digital model is meshed and cleaned; 5) a 3D model is printed (here in resin) using the digital model; 6) details are refined by hand and the model is painted.
