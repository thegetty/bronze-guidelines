A casting flaw in a relatively hidden and difficult-to-reach location under the satyr’s sand-cast-bronze right leg (left image) has been repaired from below with sheet metal pinned under the base (right image). Formally attributed to Clodion (French 1738–1814), *Nymph and Satyr*, ca. 1850–75, H. 35.6 cm (Huntington Art Museum, San Marino, California, inv. 78.20.54). See {% cite 'Bennett and Sargentson 2008' %}, 474–75.
