In-process detail of the first reconstruction by Andrew Lacey (British, b. 1969) of one of the so-called Rothschild Bronzes, attributed to Michelangelo (Italian, 1475â€“1564), H. 91.2 cm (private collection). The fresh casting has just been broken free from its investment. Note the marked granular texture of the bronze surface and the white plaster investment heavily bonded to it.
