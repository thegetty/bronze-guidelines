X-radiograph of the forearm of a monumental Roman statue cast by the lost-wax process. The long, dark, linear area corresponds to a thinning in the original wax model where wax slabs were not joined all the way through. The area would have been filled with core material and the imperfection was thus translated into bronze. *Arm of Essegney*, Roman, Essegney, France, probably 2nd–3rd century CE, L. from hand to elbow 43 cm (Musée départemental d’art ancien et contemporain d’Epinal, France, inv. M0536_2005.2.1). See {% cite 'Caumont et al. 2006' %}.
