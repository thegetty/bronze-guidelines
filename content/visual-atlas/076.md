Juxtaposition of these two indirect lost-wax casts shows how their assemblage from separate wax parts—in this case, the limbs and torso (as confirmed by X-radiography)—can result in slight variations in their postures. Willem van Tetrode (ca. 1525–1580), *Striding Warrior*, 1562–65, H. 40 cm (Collection of Mr. & Mrs. J. Thomilson Hill, New York [left]) and H. 39.4 cm (Hearn Family Trust, New York [right]).
