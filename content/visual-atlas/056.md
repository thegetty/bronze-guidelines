Detail of the lower portion of a lost-wax after-cast of a Renaissance partially gilded silver plaquette as cast. The myriad small bronze spherules (see overlay) result from air bubbles in the poorly applied plaster-based investment slurry, which settled on the surface of the wax inter-model. Francesca G. Bewer after-cast (private collection) made from an electrotype copy (date unknown) after Galeazzo Mondella (Italian, 1467â€“1528), *Sacra Conversazione*, ca. 1510, H. 13.9 cm (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, inv. Kunstkammer, 1107).
