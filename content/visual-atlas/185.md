Flow fusion welding repair. Each darkly outlined ovoid shape represents a fusion welding pour. The dark line is created at the melted zone between the fresh metal and the original bronze wall. It would not have been visible originally, but differences in the microstructure have led to corrosion variations. Statue of a Youth, ancient Rome, probably Asia Minor, ca. 140 CE, H. 142.6 cm (Toledo Museum of Art, purchased with funds from the Libbey Endowment, gift of Edward Rummond Libbey, inv. 1966.126).
