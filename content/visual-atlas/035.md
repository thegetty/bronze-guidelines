Detail of an annotated digital X-radiograph showing transverse core pins in both thighs (yellow overlays), one running side to side, the other front to back. A circular plug (green overlay) and rectangular surface patch (blue overlay) repair the holes left in the bronze wall when the front-to-back core pins were cut off at the surface and pushed into the hollow bronze cavity. Giovanni Battista Foggini (Italian, 1652â€“1725), *Dancing Faun*, ca. 1700, H. 54 cm (J. Paul Getty Museum, inv. 2000.8).
