The bright bottle-green patina is not a chemical patina, but rather a coating that was painted on. It is worn through on several high points and chipped off in a few areas. After Antoine-Louis Barye (French, 1795–1875), *Panther of Tunis*, ca. 1930–39, H. 13.3 (Harvard Art Museums / Fogg Museum, The Henry Dexter Sharpe Collection, inv. 1956.169).
