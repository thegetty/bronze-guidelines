Detail of a cast-on repair on the back of the doe with dovetails that lock the repair in place (red overlay). The color variation between the repair and the primary casting (left) is due to the diverse microstructures and resulting corrosion of these sections. The corresponding gamma radiograph (right) helps to clarify the location of the different repairs (blue overlay) as well as the heavy porosity in the cast-on metal (dark spots). Barthélemy Prieur (French, ca. 1536–1611), *Diana the Huntress*, 1603, H. 200 cm (Musée national du château de Fontainebleau, France, inv. RF 261). See %%Castelle 2016%%.
