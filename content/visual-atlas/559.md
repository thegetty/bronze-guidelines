Detail of dancer’s head showing how the bronze reproduces the blob of wax that Degas used in his original model to reinforce the jawline (green overlay). The cast also captures the quick gesture with which he pressed wax in to form the eye socket and pinched the displaced wax out into a fine ridge to form the nose, and the streak of his fingerprint up the side of the dancer’s head (indicated by the white arrows). Edgar Degas (French, 1834–1917), *Grande Arabesque, Third Time,* ca. 1885–90, H. 40.6 cm (Harvard Art Museums / Fogg Museum, bequest from the Collection of Maurice Wertheim, Class of 1906, 1951.78).
