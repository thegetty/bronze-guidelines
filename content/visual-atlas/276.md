Detail of the surface of a lost-wax cast statuette. Only digital microscopy (see [fig. 279](/visual-index/279)) proved efficient in overcoming the wear and corroded surface, thus revealing that the linear details were V-shaped and sharply defined, and thus indicative of having been made or reinforced by a graver. *Statuette of Jambhala*, Java, first half of the 9th century, H. 28 cm (Musée national des arts asiatiques – Guimet, Paris, inv. MG 3814). See {% cite 'Mechling et al. 2018' %}.
