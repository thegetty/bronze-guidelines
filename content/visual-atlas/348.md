Detail of the face of the Reclining Vishnu. Because of heavy corrosion, the inlays are no longer visible, but only known through surface analysis: copper has been detected in the lips, and lead in the moustache and beard. Composition of the eye inlays is unknown. Note texture in the eyebrows of material probably used to attach the inlay. *Reclining Vishnu*, West Mebon (Khmer), 12th century, L. 220 cm (National Museum of Cambodia, inv. Ga 5387).
