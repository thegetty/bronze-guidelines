Detail of the face of the Reclining Vishnu. Because of heavy corrosion, the inlays are no longer visible, but only known through surface analysis: lead has been detected in the eyebrows, moustache, and beard. Composition of the eye inlays is unknown. Note texture in the eyebrows of material probably used to attach the inlay. *Reclining Vishnu*, West Mebon (Khmer), 12th century, L. 220 cm (National Museum of Cambodia, inv. Ga 5387).
