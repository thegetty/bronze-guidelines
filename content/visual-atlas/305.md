Decision chart for assessing the condition and characterizing an archaeological patina layer (in a museum laboratory setting). The protocol can be useful for the study of other surface layers as well, including metal plating and inlays. Three scenarios are covered: Top of chart: sampling is not possible; Middle of chart: cross section sampling is possible; Bottom of chart: powder or flake samples are available. The expected outcome of each approach is indicated at the bottom of the chart.
