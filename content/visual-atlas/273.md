3D model of an engraved line (approximately 1 mm across) in a lost-wax cast statuette. The blurred V shape of the imprint results from the chasing tool following along a line already present in the wax model. The image was generated by a digital microscope using automated focus stacking. *Statuette of Jambhala*, Java, first half of the 9th century, H. 28 cm (Musée national des arts asiatiques – Guimet, Paris, inv. MG 3814). See {% cite 'Mechling et al. 2018' %}.
