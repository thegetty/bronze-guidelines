3D model of a chiseled line generated by a digital microscope using automated focus stacking. The line, on a lost-wax cast statuette, is approximately 1 mm across. Click on the 3D image to turn it to visualize the altered V shape of the imprint, which demonstrates that the engraving in the metal was made by following a line already in the wax model. *Statuette of Jambhala*, Java, first half of the 9th century, H. 28 cm (Musée national des arts asiatiques – Guimet, Paris, inv. MG 3814). See {% cite 'Mechling et al. 2018' %}.
