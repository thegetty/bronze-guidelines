Radiograph showing the integration of square-sectioned iron armature elements extending up out of Aristotleâ€™s arm and leg. The sharp bend at their tops suggests a point of overlap with additional elements and a potentially different technical approach to the fabrication of armatures. *Aquamanile in the Form of Phyllis and Aristotle*, southern Netherlands, late 14th or early 15th century, H. 32.5 cm (Metropolitan Museum of Art, Robert Lehman Collection, 1975, inv. 1975.1.1416).
