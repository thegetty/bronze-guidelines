{% ref fig='fig-009' text='1)' region='200,150,1040,1350' %} a chef-modèle or pattern is a specially designed model for sand casting made of a hard material—often metal—to withstand the repeated handling and ramming of sand within a multipart, stacked metal or wooden frame called a casting flask; 

{% ref fig='fig-009' text='2)' region='1400,150,1400,1350' %} the pattern is buried about halfway in backing sand in a first section of the flask called the cope; piece mold sections are built up over the model with carefully rammed special casting sand whose naturally occurring binder, clay, helps the compacted sand to hold the desired shape; 

{% ref fig='fig-009' text='3)' region='2800,150,1330,1350' %} once the exposed part of the pattern is covered with mold pieces, the second section of the flask, or “drag,” is affixed to the cope and the piece molded side is back filled with carefully rammed sand; 

{% ref fig='fig-009' text='4)' region='4200,150,1270,1350' %} the tightly packed flask is flipped; the cope and backing sand, now on top, are removed to provide access for a similar piece molding process to be performed on the other side of the chef-modèle; 

{% ref fig='fig-009' text='5)' region='5500,150,2100,1350' %} the two-part casting flask is parted and the mold pieces carefully disassembled to remove the pattern; 

{% ref fig='fig-009' text='6)' region='200,2250,1200,1500' %} to make a hollow cast, a core must be created to define the thickness of the bronze walls; this is made by ramming the same special casting sand into the hollow impression left by the chef-modèle; metal core supports are incorporated into the new sand; the cope and drag are joined, thereby creating a sand replica;
