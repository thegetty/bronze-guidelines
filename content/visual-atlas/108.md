This work was cast in several parts and then bolted together in the metal. The chasing perfectly conceals any trace of the assemblage, which only becomes apparent from the underside (see [fig. 107](/visual-atlas/#fig-107){target=_blank}). Antoine-Louis Barye (French, 1795â€“1875), *Lion Devouring a Boar*, ca. 1865, H. 16.9 cm (Harvard Art Museums / Fogg Museum, The Henry Dexter Sharpe Collection, inv. 1956.150).
