X-radiograph showing a complex armature made of different sizes of rods and wire (11 mm, 7 mm, and 4 mm in diameter). See also the wax-to-wax joints. A 15 mm Cu filter was needed to keep the same exposure parameters for all the different areas of the sculpture, despite the significant variations in thickness (400kV, 8mA, 15 min. exposure, 3 m source-to-object distance, AA400PB film). Antoine-Louis Barye (French, 1795–1875), *Theseus and the Centaur Bienor*, cast by Eugène Gonon (1814–1892) in 1877, H. 1.3 m (Musée du Louvre, inv. RF 3882). For daylight photography of the statue see [fig. 395](/visual-atlas/395/). See %%C2RMF Internal Report 2016b%%.
