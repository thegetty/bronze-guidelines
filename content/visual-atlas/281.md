Digital micrographs comparing the results of experimental chasing using a tracer on two different metals in two different metallurgical states. View of the chisel (left), the mark left in the as-cast tin-bronze and its dimensions (middle), and the mark in the laminated sheet of unalloyed electrolytic copper and dimensions (right). The copper sheet, having not been annealed, is much harder than the as-cast bronze, and consequently the mark is much shallower. Chasing by Dominique Robcis during the CAST:ING chiseling workshop, C2RMF, Paris, May 2017.
