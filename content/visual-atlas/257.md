Detail of breast showing a lengthy inscription in the area across the diaphragm/solar plexus. The letters are quite irregular in shape and not deeply chased, which might testify to their cold working in the metal rather than in the wax. Bronze Statue of Hawtar’athat, Yemen, 1st millennium BCE, H. 140 cm (National Museum of Sana’a, Yemen, inv. YM 23206). See {% cite 'Mille et al. 2010' %}; {% cite 'Mille et al. 2012' %}. See [fig. 20](/visual-atlas/020/) for an overall view.
