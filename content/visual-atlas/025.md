Diagram depicting a version of the cut-back-core process: 

{% ref fig='fig-025' text='1)' region='50,0,1430,2260' %} a plaster piece mold composed of smaller pieces to account for the undercuts is formed on the model; the sections are held together by an outer mother mold; 

{% ref fig='fig-025' text='2)' region='1350,0,1310,2260' %} the piece mold is removed from the model; core support rods and wires are positioned as needed in the partially reassembled empty mold; 

{% ref fig='fig-025' text='3)' region='2560,0,1260,2260' %} the mold is fully reassembled and filled with refractory material (here plaster-based) to create a replica of the original model; 

{% ref fig='fig-025' text='4)' region='3760,0,1040,2260' %} the surface of the replica is pared down (cut back) to form the core of the mold, thereby creating the space that will be filled first by wax and later by metal; 

{% ref fig='fig-025' text='5)' region='50,2770,1430,2260' %} the cut-back core is placed back into the piece mold, suspended in place by the core support rods that also serve as core pins in this example; 

{% ref fig='fig-025' text='6)' region='1390,2770,1170,2260' %} molten wax is filled into the cavity around the core, thereby creating the inter-model; 

{% ref fig='fig-025' text='7)' region='2530,2770,1290,2260' %} the inter-model is removed from the mold and reworked as needed; the sprue system is joined to it with a heated tool and the assemblage is invested in a refractory mold; 

{% ref fig='fig-025' text='8)' region='3760,2480,1330,2550' %} the mold is baked to dry it thoroughly and to burn out all traces of the wax; 

{% ref fig='fig-025' text='9)' region='0,5330,1580,2550' %} the mold is filled with molten metal; 

{% ref fig='fig-025' text='10)' region='1510,5620,1440,2260' %} the bronze is freed of the investment, sprues, and protruding core supports; 

{% ref fig='fig-025' text='11)' region='2860,5620,1270,2260' %} in the final stages the bronze surface may be refinished with details, then joined to the separately cast arms and base and a patina applied.
