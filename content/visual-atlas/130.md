Detail of the rear of the Matilda statuette showing different tool marks. The wider striations on the right and bottom were most likely made in the clay model. The finer parallel lines coming down on the left at a diagonal in the fold appear to have been made at the wax stage with a finer-toothed tool. After a model by Gian Lorenzo Bernini (Italian, 1598–1680), *Countess Matilda of Tuscany*, ca. 1633–34, H. 40 cm (Harvard Art Museums / Fogg Museum, partial gift of Max Falk and partial purchase through the Director’s Acquisition Fund, 1998.1).
