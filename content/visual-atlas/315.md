This statue was retrieved from the bottom of the ocean, heavily encrusted with marine deposits and corrosion layers. It is pictured here after mechanical cleaning, revealing a fairly smooth, continuous layer that is assumed to be close to the original surface. In the process, embedded copper chloride was also exposed, rendering the sculpture vulnerable to outbreaks of occasional active corrosion. For its long-term preservation, it is displayed and constantly monitored in an entirely desiccated gallery, which is continuously fed dry air. *Statue of a Victorious Youth*, Greek, 300â€“100 BCE, H. 151.5 cm (J. Paul Getty Museum, inv. 77.AB.30).
