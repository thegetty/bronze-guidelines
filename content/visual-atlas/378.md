Two 3D models of different versions of a terra-cotta sculpture were made using a structured light scanner. By overlaying the scans, it is clear that the torsos are closely aligned. The hands, hair, and lapels are misaligned, suggesting possible joint locations for the separately mold-made parts. Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse (French, 1824–1887), *Model for a Monument to Alexandre Dumas*, 1885, H. 76 cm (Musée Carnavalet, Paris, inv. S1893; Musée Alexandre Dumas, Villers-Cotterêts, France, inv. 91.2.54). See {% cite 'Carré 2005' %}.
