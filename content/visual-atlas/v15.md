For each, several samples were taken at various distances from the bronze wall in order to check the possible effects of an airport X-ray scan during the bronze’s transportation from Sana’a to Paris. *Bronze Statue of Hawtar’athat*, Yemen, 1st millennium BCE, H. 140 cm (National Museum of Sana’a, inv. YM 23206). See {% cite 'Mille et al. 2010' %}.
