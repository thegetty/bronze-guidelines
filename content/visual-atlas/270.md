Effect of air abrasive (glass beads) on a copper-alloy surface bearing different cold-work marks: punches, chisels, stamps for marking editions and dates. The abraded surface (top half of image) is softened, and tool marks appear as if they were done in the wax rather than the metal. Didactic sheet by Andrew Lacey, May 2019.
