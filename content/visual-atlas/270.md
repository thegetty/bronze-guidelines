Comparison of select punch marks created on a copper alloy surface in which the upper half has been abraded (blasted with glass beads), to demonstrate how this dulls their crisp contours and makes them appear as if they were done in the wax rather than the metal. Didactic sheet by Andrew Lacey, May 2019.
