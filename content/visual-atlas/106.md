Detail of the reverse of a gilded brass relief figure shows the grainy texture of the sand mold, the gouge marks of the original carved model that were replicated in the bronze, as well as the patched, brazed repairs with flux damage. Relief figure of Benjamin Franklin, purportedly cast by Paul Revere (American, ca. 1735–1818) after a wood model by Simon Skillen, from Joseph Pope’s (American, 1750–1826) *Grand Orrery*, 1776–87, H. 31 cm (Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, Harvard University, inv. 0005).
