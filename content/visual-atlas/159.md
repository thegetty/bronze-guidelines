Detail of a cold shut on the proper right shoulder of the figure of Laocoön caused by premature cooling of the metal during the pour. Corrosion has accentuated the line where the cooling metal entered the mold from two different locations. Adriaen de Vries (Netherlandish, 1556–1626), *Laocoön and His Sons*, 1623, H. 169 cm (Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, inv. Drh Sk 68).
