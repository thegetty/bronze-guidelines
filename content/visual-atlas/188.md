Brazing metal (arrows) secures the separately cast back right leg and patch repair (yellow overlay). Brazing is confirmed by the elevated levels of zinc detected by XRF along the joint. Raised corrosion along the joints was probably caused by the remains of flux on the surface. Unidentified foundry, after Antoine Coysevox (French, 1640–1720), *Fame*, 1700–1710, H. 60.3 cm (Huntington Art Museum, San Marino, California, inv. 14.14). See %%Bennett and Sargentson 2008%%, 479.
