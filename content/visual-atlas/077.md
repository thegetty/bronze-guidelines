Detailed image of a small area of the chin showing flashing in the refractory mold that has been filed down. The lines are so angular, they look like the intersecting lines of a mold. Andrew Lacey (British, b. 1969), *Head of Henry Tonks*, cast by the artist in 2015, H. 17 cm (artistâ€™s collection).
