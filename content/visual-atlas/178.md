The separately cast arm is attached with a Roman sleeve joint (red line). A large patch fills a flaw along the joint (blue overlay). A second patch is unrelated to the joint (green overlay). Threaded circular plugs (yellow overlays) help lock the arm joint and patches in place. Jean-Antoine Houdon (French, 1741–1828), *Diana*, 1782, H. 208.3 cm (Huntington Art Museum, San Marino, California, inv. 27.186).
