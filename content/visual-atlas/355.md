Detail of front inlay. Previously thought to be enamel, under microscopic examination by Michael Wagner and Rainer Richter (Grünes Gewölbe) all the blue inlays were shown to be blue glass with oil-bound gold pigment on top. Filarete (Antonio di Pietro Averlino, Italian, ca. 1400–1469), *Marcus Aurelius*, 1440–45, H. 38 cm (Grünes Gewölbe, Dresden, inv. H4 155/037). Personal communication with Claudia Kryza-Gersch, 2018.
