Detail showing the eyes inlaid with silver, and the bridge of the nose, lips, and sideburns for evidence of where the mercury gilding dripped while being applied, or did not stay within intended boundaries. Note the black patina typical of Antico and the particularly glossy surface. Pier Jacopo Alari Bonacolsi, known as Antico (Italian, ca. 1455–1528), *Meleager*, ca. 1484–90, H. 32.2 cm with original base (Victoria and Albert Museum, purchased with support from the Horn Bequest, the Bryan Bequest, and Art Fund, inv. A.27-1960). See {% cite 'Stone 1981' %}; {% cite 'Smith and Sturman 2011' %}; {% cite 'Motture 2019' %}.
