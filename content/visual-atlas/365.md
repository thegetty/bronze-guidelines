The *Mensa Isiaca*, a bronze table or altar, is decorated with three registers of Egyptian-style images, the goddess Isis in its center, and with pseudo hieroglyphs.Â  All imagery and script were created by inlays of various metals and alloys, often multipart, some of which may have been intentionally patinated in antiquity to create a complex, polychrome surface. *Mensa Isiaca*, Roman, 1st century CE, H. 75.5 cm (Turin Museo Egizio, Italy, inv. 715).
