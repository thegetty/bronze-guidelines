After several trials in the early twentieth century to preserve the original dark-brown patina, this sculpture that stands in front of the MFA Boston was painted green at the artist’s behest to suggest even, natural corrosion. Cyrus Dallin (American, 1861–1944), *Appeal to the Great Spirit*, 1908, H. 309.9 cm (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, inv. 13.380). See %%Newman 2011%%, 36.
