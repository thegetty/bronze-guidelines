Patches used to repair casting flaws on the right arm are made of unalloyed copper. They were less corroded during burial than the surrounding tin bronze. This phenomenon is probably due to differences of metallurgical state and subsequent porosity: the patches are hammered and much less porous than the primary cast. *Reclining Vishnu*, West Mebon (Khmer), 12th century, L. 220 cm (National Museum of Cambodia, inv. Ga 5387). See {% cite 'CAST:ING 2018' %}.
