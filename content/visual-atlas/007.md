Building up the ceramic shell mold by repeatedly dipping the wax inter-model into colloidal silica slurry then coating that wet layer with one of larger refractory particles to build up a thick composite layer that will form a “ceramic shell” through sintering of the colloidal particles. Andrew Lacey (British, b. 1969), *The Anatomy of Bronze*, cast by the artist in 2019, Devon, UK, H. 45 cm (artist’s collection).
