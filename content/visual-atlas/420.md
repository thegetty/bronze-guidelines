Bright field photomicrograph of an etched polished cross section of the welding zone of an experimental sample. See the dendritic microstructure and small grains due to recrystallization in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) generated by flow fusion welding. The outlines of dendrites appear brown; the interdendritic space is filled with eutectoïd phase alfa + delta (in blue). Sample E66, binary bronze CuSn10. See {% cite 'Azéma et al. 2012' %}; {% cite 'Azéma and Mille 2013a' %}.
