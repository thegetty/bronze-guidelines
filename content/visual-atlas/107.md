View from underside showing the angular shapes of the inner surface that are characteristic of pared-down sand-cast cores. As is also typical with sand casts, the group was made in pieces and assembled in the metal. None of these joints are visible from the outer surface. Antoine-Louis Barye (French, 1795â€“1875), *Lion Devouring a Boar*, ca. 1865, H. 16.9 cm (Harvard Art Museums / Fogg Museum, The Henry Dexter Sharpe Collection, inv. 1956.150).
