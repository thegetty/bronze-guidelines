This internal view of a small arm shows an extant wire core pin and the uneven blobby accretions at its point of contact with the inner surface. These occurred during casting, with the molten-metal-filled gaps created in the core when the wire was pushed through the core-filled wax model, causing some localized breakdown. Andrew Lacey (British, b.1969), *Hand*, 1998, H. 18 cm (private collection).
