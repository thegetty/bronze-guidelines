The underside of the base reveals numerous features indicative of sand casting: the overall angular and geometric contours of the base (red arrows); seam lines likely formed between sections of the core (yellow lines); the larger seam lines (flashing) appear to have been chiseled down); nuts on threaded rods used to secure the separately cast figures (white overlay); hammering to better align the joined sections (green overlay). Traces of the sand mold are present (examples overlaid in blue). Francois-Auguste-Hippolyte Peyrol (French, 1856â€“1929), *Indian Fighting Cougar* (French title according to the inscription plaque is *La Lutte pour la vie*), cast in France, marked Peyrol foundry, inscription date 1933 (probably cast prior to 1927, when the foundry closed), H. 75 cm (collection of George Syrmos).
