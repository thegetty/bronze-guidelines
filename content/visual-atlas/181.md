Cast-on repair process: 

{% ref fig='fig-181' text='1)' region='0,40,1020,610' %} casting flaw that extends through the wall of the bronze; 

{% ref fig='fig-181' text='2)' region='960,40,1000,610' %} the edges of the flaw are cleaned up and core under the flawed area is partially excavated; 

{% ref fig='fig-181' text='3)' region='0,660,1000,610' %} the flawed surface is modeled in wax; a pouring cup and vent are added; 

{% ref fig='fig-181' text='4)' region='960,660,1000,610' %} the wax is invested; heat is applied locally until the wax melts out; 

{% ref fig='fig-181' text='5)' region='0,1330,1000,610' %} bronze is poured into the temporary mold; when cool, the investment is removed; 

{% ref fig='fig-181' text='6)' region='960,1330,1000,610' %} the pouring cup and vent are removed; the surface is chased to minimize the thin gap between the bulk metal and the cast-on repair caused due to shrinkage, and to unify the surface of the bronze.
