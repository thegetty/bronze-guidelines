Cast-on repair process: 1) casting flaw that extends through the wall of the bronze; 2) the edges of the flaw are cleaned up and core under the flawed area is partially excavated; 3) the flawed surface is modeled in wax; a pouring cup and vent are added; 4) the wax is invested; heat is applied locally until the wax melts out; 5) bronze is poured into the temporary mold; when cool, the investment is removed; 6) the pouring cup and vent are removed; the surface is chased to minimize the thin gap between the bulk metal and the cast-on repair caused due to shrinkage, and to unify the surface of the bronze.
