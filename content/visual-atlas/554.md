The backs of all four gilded brass reliefs show identical gouge marks—evidence that they were sand cast from the same carved wooden pattern. Relief figures of Benjamin Franklin, purportedly cast by Paul Revere (American, ca. 1735–1818) after a wood model by Simon Skillen, from Joseph Pope’s (American, 1750–1826) *Grand Orrery*, 1776–87, H. 31 cm (Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, Harvard University, inv. 0005).
