Dan Kendall of New England Sculpture Service fabricated the stainless-steel armature while assembling the separately cast bronze parts of the monument (left). It was welded in to provide structural support and to anchor the work to its base. The detail inside the raven (right) seen here from the bottom was taken mid-process.
