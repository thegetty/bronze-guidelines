Photomicrograph of punch marks in experimental cast produced during the 2004 ancient materials and technologies workshop “The Technical Analysis of Renaissance Bronze Casting” (AMTeC), Chatham Dockyard, UK. The same punch was used in the metal after casting (left), where it preserves its crisp outline, and in the wax before casting (right), where the distortion of the punch mark, the ridge of displaced malleable material along the edge, and the loss of crispness are all more common in marks made in the wax.
