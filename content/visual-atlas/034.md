Overlaying the daylight photograph and the X-radiograph of a sculpture helps to separate out forms that are part of the visible composition (e.g., folds of the drapery or overlapping body parts) from information about the internal structure (such as the joint in the neck, the armature, and the wire wrapping the core of the right arm) shown in the layer with the interpretive diagram. Barthélemy Prieur (French, 1536–1611), *Abundance*, cast in 1571 by Nicolas Péron, H. 128 cm (Musée du Louvre, inv. MR1681). See [Case Study 5](/case-studies/5/).
