Exposure to a harsh urban environment has altered any original patina into a mottled, discolored, and somewhat powdery corroded surface that is very different from the original appearance. William Henry Rinehart (American, 1825–1874), *Endymion*, 1874, L. 182.9 cm (marker for the sculptor’s own grave at Greenmount Cemetery, Baltimore).
