Two patinated copper-alloy plates (red and black) showing the influence of surface texture on the perception of color. For each plate (~20 Ã— 20 cm), the upper half of the surface has been left as-cast, while the lower half has been polished before patination. Samples provided to the C2RMF by the Coubertin foundry, France, in the late 1990s.
