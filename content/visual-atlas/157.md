The many losses and worn appearance of the statuette are probably a result of ill-controlled electrolytic cleaning. *Youth Holding an Oinochoe and Strainer*, Greek, second quarter of the 5th century BCE, H. 11.8 cm (Harvard Art Museums / Arthur M. Sackler Museum, gift of Mrs. Edward Jackson Holmes, inv. 1952.20).
