Lines of holes run between the lobes of the ears and across the upper lip of a brass Ife head. Based on ethnographic parallels, these may possibly be for the attachment of added elements. Red paint is used to add color to feathers; tubular beads and rosettes and traces of black paint appear on incised elements of the crown. Ife head, Yoruba, probably 14thâ€“early 15th century, H. 35 cm (British Museum, inv. Af1939,34.1).
