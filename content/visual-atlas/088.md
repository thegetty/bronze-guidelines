Inside view of the horse head showing tide lines from the flow of liquid wax captured on the inner surface of the bronze. A fully preserved internal sprue is seen here cutting across the inside at the base of the neck. And several circular areas along the rim of the cast are where sprues connecting to the casting cup were cut off during fettling. Andrew Lacey (British, b. 1969), *The Anatomy of Bronze*, cast by the artist in 2019, Devon, UK, H. 45 cm (artistâ€™s collection).
