Bright field photomicrograph of an etched polished cross section of the welded zone between the body and the neck of a bronze horse. Zone B corresponds to the filler metal (oval area of a basin), zone A to the neck of the horse (primary casting). The yellowish area between A and B is the melted zone (MZ) and the heat-affected zone (HAZ), which consist of a mixture of the filler metal and the primary cast. This area is also marked by heavy porosity (black holes). Note that the elemental composition of the weld metal is strictly the same as that of the primary cast—that is, the neck (leaded bronze with 9.6 wt% Sn and 7.2 wt% Pb). *Horse of Neuvy-en-Sullias*, France, 1st century BCE–1st century CE, H. 113 cm (Musée historique et archéologique de l’Orléanais, Orléans, France, inv. A6286). See %%Mille 2007%%.
