Wax reproduction of the head of the *Apollo of Lillebonne* made during the 2016 CAST:ING meeting, Coubertin foundry, France. This wax was obtained by slush molding in a plaster piece mold. All the mold lines (seam lines) are clearly visible. Note the distortion of the model due to imperfection in the piece mold assemblage. The height is 18 cm (two-thirds of the original size). Original: *Apollo of Lillebonne*, France, 1st century BCE–1st century CE, H. 193 cm (Musée du Louvre, inv. Br37 [NIII65]). See [fig. 288](/visual-atlas/288/).
