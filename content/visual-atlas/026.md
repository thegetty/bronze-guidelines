Diagram depicting a speculative version of the ancient Chinese piece mold casting process: 

{% ref fig='fig-026' text='1)' region='110,0,1700,1510' %} a model of the You vessel with lid is prepared out of loess (a fine-grained refractory soil found throughout northern China) and baked dry; 

{% ref fig='fig-026' text='2)' region='1680,0,2100,1510' %} the piece mold segments need to account for undercuts in the model; half of the upper part is covered in loess to form the first section of the mold; it is smoothed and keyed to ensure alignment of the next section; 

{% ref fig='fig-026' text='3)' region='3630,0,2230,1510' %} the second section of the mold is built up alongside the first and allowed to dry and harden; the mold segments are carefully removed from the model; 

{% ref fig='fig-026' text='4)' region='5730,0,1950,1510' %} in order to make the core, the top two pieces of the mold are reassembled and packed tightly with loess to form a replica of the original model and to add a base; 

{% ref fig='fig-026' text='5)' region='140,2170,1750,1510' %} the mold is opened and the outer surface of the loess replica is cut back (pared down) to create a core that, once repositioned in the outer mold, will help define the space to be filled with molten metal; 

{% ref fig='fig-026' text='6)' region='1750,2170,1750,1510' %} at this stage additional details can be carved into the face of the mold; 

{% ref fig='fig-026' text='7)' region='3340,1850,1750,1830' %} the mold sections are reassembled around the core and a funnel/gate is cut into the mold; the assembled mold is baked until dry and filled with molten bronze;

{% ref fig='fig-026' text='8)' region='5010,2170,2030,1510' %} the mold is removed and the gate cut off; except for some basic removal of flashing and sprues, the surface would merely be polished; 

{% ref fig='fig-026' text='9)' region='6930,2170,1260,1510' %} the bronze lid and body of the vessel (produced by the same process) are fine-tuned to fit perfectly.
