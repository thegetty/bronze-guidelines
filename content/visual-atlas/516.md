Annotated neutron radiograph of side view, showing more clearly than the X-radiograph ([fig. 515](/visual-atlas/#fig-515){target=_blank}) the contours of the sealing material (red overlay) and some of the consecration offerings. For an even better visualization of the consecration offerings, see tomographic images of a related figure ([figs. 403](/visual-atlas/#fig-403){target=_blank}, [404](/visual-atlas/#fig-404){target=_blank}). *Kubera/Jambhala*, Java, first half of the 10th century, H. 18 cm (Musée national des arts asiatiques – Guimet, Paris, inv. MG 3625). See %%Mechling et al. 2018%%.
