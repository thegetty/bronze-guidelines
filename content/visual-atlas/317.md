Raised black islands on the surface of this badly corroded sculpture are due to aggressive urban air pollution over more than a century. A recent maintenance treatment of dark-tinted wax has minimized the surface color variation, although, as seen in the detail of the base with the foundry mark, the irregular surface texture caused by the corrosion is still quite apparent. Antoine-Louis Barye (French, 1795–1875), *La Guerre* (War), 1884 cast from 1855–56 model, H. 102 cm (Mount Vernon Place, Baltimore, given to the City of Baltimore by William Thompson Walters).
