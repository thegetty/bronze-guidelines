The statue was cast in two sections—the figures with halo, and the base—which were joined by hammering the top edge of the base over the sculpture’s footplate to secure it. The red arrows in the overlay point to areas of overlap. *Shiva Nataraja (Lord of the Dance)*, India, state of Tamil Nadu, Chola dynasty, ca. 990, H. 70.8 cm (Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M.
