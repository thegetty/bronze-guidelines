Two bronze cylinders (H. ~30 cm each) made by the Coubertin foundry, France, in the 1990s for the Mus√©e du Louvre to show the different steps of casting and finishing. The as-cast state at the bottom of both cylinders is somewhat exaggerated. Note the triangular sprue and cylindrical vent in the left example, and their removal at right.
