Inside view of a bronze reproduction of the head of the *Apollo of Lillebonne* made by the lasagna process during the 2016 CAST:ING meeting at the Coubertin foundry, France. The outer contours of the hair are not at all visible on the simplified interior of the head. See the working marks of the clay sheet (lasagna), and particularly the thick joint between the two main sheets crossing the length of the head (red arrows). The height is 18 cm (two-thirds of the original size). Original: *Apollo of Lillebonne*, France, 1st century BCE–1st century CE, H. 193 cm (Musée du Louvre, inv. Br37 [NIII65]). See [fig. 288](/visual-atlas/288/).
