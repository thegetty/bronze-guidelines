During the initial fettling stages the removal of the main feed on the side of the horse was carried out using a course file and large scraper to reduce or rectify the surface. The scraper produced chatter lines—here the short, parallel, vertical cuts—and the file the longer, undulating horizontal marks that reflect brightly against the surrounding darker, as-cast oxidized surface. Finer files and scrapers are used subsequently to smooth out these marks. Andrew Lacey (British, b. 1969), *Pacing Horse*, 2016, H. 23 cm, after-cast of bronze attributed to Gianfrancesco Susini (Italian, ca. 1585–1653) after a model by Giambologna (Italian, 1529–1608) (private collection).
