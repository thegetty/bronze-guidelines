Detail of a tabernacle relief (H. 25 cm). The relief was cast with a large flaw. The figure of Christ was entirely remodeled in wax and cast separately in bronze. The cast repair was then inserted into the casting flaw and chased. Due to differences in the color of the alloy, the repair became visible while cleaning the surface (upper image). As seen at the back (lower image), once inserted in the primary cast, the newly cast repair was hammered to secure it. Note: the lower image has been rotated 180 degrees so that the two images are visually aligned. Girolamo (Italian, ca. 1510–1584/89) and Ludovico Lombardo (Italian, 1507/8–1575), Tabernacle, Chapel of the Holy Sacrament, Fermo Cathedral, Marche, Italy, by 1570–71, H. 230 cm.
