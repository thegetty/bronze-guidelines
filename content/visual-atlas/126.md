X-radiograph of frontal view, showing that the figure is cast solid. The concentration of porosity in the legs supports the hypothesis of an upside-down casting. *Ten-Armed Avalokiteśvara*, Java, first half of the 9th century, H. 34 cm (Musée national des arts asiatiques – Guimet, Paris, inv. MG 3816). See {% cite 'Mechling et al. 2018' %}.
