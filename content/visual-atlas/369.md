An image of a sculpture 150 cm high, photographed at a resolution of 2048 × 1536 pixels, will not resolve details at the mm scale (see inset at top right). Macro photography is necessary to resolve fine features such as tool marks and signatures (see inset at bottom right). *Statue of a Victorious Youth*, Greek, 300–100 BCE, H. 151.5 cm (J. Paul Getty Museum, Villa Collection, inv. 77.AB.30).
