Detail of the surface of a fake Han dynasty bronze showing the blistering electro-gilding. The width of the field of view is 1.5 cm. The blisters are tiny raised gold spots in the gilding that indicate the bronze was poorly cleaned to prepare for the gilding process. The visible red waxy deposits were applied by the forger to “age” the finish. Modern forgery of a Chinese Han period (202 BCE–220 CE) cast bronze in the form of a bear, H. 17.2 cm (British Museum, reg. no. 1947,0712.382). See %%Jones 1990%%, 257.
