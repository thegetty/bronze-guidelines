Artist Andrew Lacey states: “The area between the breast or middle of the chest near the heart was moistened just prior to casting. This subjected the bronze to violent steam gassing, porosity, and a small vertical hole in the casting. It is highly organic in form and texture but leaves a mark that suggests weakness or wounding, or at least as a question in itself.” Personal communication to the authors, 2019. Andrew Lacey (British, b. 1969), *Mud Ash Ochre*, 2009, life-size torso (artist’s collection).
