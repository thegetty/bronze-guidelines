Set of examination and testing protocols for the characterization of a patina layer both for sculpture that is not likely to have been buried and for archaeological bronzes. For the latter, these are very general notes; the question of burial might be more nuanced than presented here and can lead to much more complex situations (e.g., archaeological bronzes may be subsequently coated). See [fig. 305](/visual-atlas/305/) for more details on the relevant techniques of analysis.
