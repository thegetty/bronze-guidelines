This chef-modèle has been cast in four sections (here assembled by way of interlocking pins, ridges, and slots) so as to provide more manageable segments to be sand molded and cast separately. Antoine-Louis Barye (French, 1795–1875), *Lion and Serpent* (No. 2), chef-modèle cast by Victor Paillard, ca. 1858, H. 18.4 cm (Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, inv. 27.92).
