Detail illustrating the use of a spade drill to clarify the iris and a V-shaped graver to delineate the edges of the feathers, other details, and the punch work around the snout of a dragon. The faint parallel marks across the neck are indications of the use of a scraper to help smooth the surface. *Aquamanile in the Form of a Dragon*, northern Germany, ca. 1200, H. 21.2 cm (Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Cloisters Collection, 1947, inv. 47.101.51).
