Annotated detail of a cast-on repair (left). The cast-on metal is surrounded by a thin gap due to shrinkage of the repair as it cooled. The annotated X-radiograph (right) reveals the gap around the repair and the excess metal cast into the interior of the hollow bronze as well as two tapering core pins. See [fig. 491](/visual-atlas/#fig-491){target=_blank} for a detail of the backside of the horse. *Aquamanile in the Form of a Lion*, probably northern Germany, ca. 1200, H. 21.2 cm (Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Cloisters Collection, 1947, inv. 47.101.52).
