Detail of leg, showing core material from inside the sculpture that migrated to the surface of this porous bronze when the weather was particularly wet. The surface has been covered with a tinted wax coating to reduce porosity, water incursion, and irregularities in the surface color. *Mercury*, 19th-century Italian reproduction of a bronze from Herculaneum, H. 131 cm (Baltimore Museum of Art, gift of the City of Baltimore, Department of Recreation and Parks, inv. 1948.46).
