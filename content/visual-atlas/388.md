Electron emission radiographs from different metals showing that only the atomic number of the element controls the image density: the lightest sample is aluminum, the darkest is lead. The thickness of the sample has no impact. Operating conditions are indicated at the bottom of the image (source – distance object to detector – filter – voltage/current/exposure time).
