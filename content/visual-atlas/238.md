Bronze cylinder (the portion visible is ~12 cm high) demonstrating a range of chasing marks created using the chasing tools shown in [fig. 239](/visual-atlas/239/). From bottom to top: 1) raw, as-cast texture modeled in wax; at the center is the foundry mark struck with a steel punch (*frappé*) flanked by the punched letters “F” and “C”; 2) repetitive marks of a diamond-shaped matting tool with a smoothly textured tip (in French *ciselet*, and more specifically *mat à bout lisse carré*); 3) repetitive marks of a matting punch with a textured, granular tip (*mat sablé moyen*); 4) oblique marks of a veining punch with a coarse profile/contour (*mat à tracer large* or *traçoir gros*); 5) oblique marks of a veining punch with a refined, “sharpened” profile/contour (*mat à tracer fin* or *traçoir fin*); 6) polishing cloths of increasingly finer grit (200 to 1000) followed by electrical polishing wheel; 7) repetitive marks of a very fine veining punch (*mat à tracer très fin*); 8) oblique marks of a veining punch with a rounded profile/contour (*mat à tracer large* or *traçoir gros*); 9) repetitive marks of “dot” punch with a hemispherical, indented profile/contour (*perloir* or *mat à perler*); 10) repetitive marks of a matting punch with a finely textured tip (*mat sablé fin*); 11) repetitive marks of a “circle” punch with a rounded, circular perimeter and a recessed center profile/contour (*perloir à touche* or *mat à perler*). Bronze cylinder, 1990s, H. ~30 cm, made by the Coubertin foundry, France, for the Musée du Louvre, Département des sculptures.
