{% ref fig='fig-006' anno='bronze, core, flashing, cold-shut, seam-line, lantern' text='Reset' %}

Experimental sand-cast torso (H. 16 cm). Yellow overlay indicates the hollow {% ref fig='fig-006' anno='lantern' text='lantern' %} made of rolled sheet metal that runs vertically through the body and has been used to mount the torso to a base. See also the area where the bronze did not fill the mold, an extreme example of a {% ref fig='fig-006' anno='cold-shut' text='cold shut' %}. White arrows indicate the typically rounded edge of the bronze wall where it stopped flowing. Green arrows denote the {% ref fig='fig-006' anno='seam-line' text='seam line' %} along the proper right side of the torso where bronze flowed into a gap along the joint of the cope and drag. Red arrows indicate {% ref fig='fig-006' anno='flashing' text='flashing' %} at either side of the lower horizontal armature rod. Made with consultant Tonny Beentjes, Decorative Arts and Sculpture Conservation, J. Paul Getty Museum.
