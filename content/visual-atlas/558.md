Diagram depicting a type of inversion casting: 

{% ref fig='fig-558' text='1)' region='220,0,1810,1920' %} core pins are inserted into a hollow wax model; 

{% ref fig='fig-558' text='2)' region='2180,0,1810,1920' %} the sprue system is fused onto the wax model; 

{% ref fig='fig-558' text='3)' region='4300,0,1810,1920' %} the wax model is covered in a refractory investment material; 

{% ref fig='fig-558' text='4)' region='50,2070,1810,1920' %} the mold is then heated until dry and all traces of the wax melted and burned out; 

{% ref fig='fig-558' text='5)' region='2180,2070,1810,1920' %} meanwhile, a simple receptacle that will serve as a crucible is shaped of refractory material; small pieces of bronze and charcoal are placed in the crucible, which is luted to the mold to form an enclosed unit; 

{% ref fig='fig-558' text='6)' region='4300,2070,1810,1920' %} the mold-crucible is heated until the metal is molten; 

{% ref fig='fig-558' text='7)' region='220,3990,1810,1920' %} the mold with its integral crucible is then inverted to allow the liquefied bronze to pour quickly into the mold; the charcoal helps to reduce oxidation; 

{% ref fig='fig-558' text='8)' region='2220,3990,1810,1920' %} fettling includes breaking off the refractory mold, removing the core pins, and cutting away the sprue system; 

{% ref fig='fig-558' text='9)' region='4300,3990,1810,1920' %} chasing may consist of polishing, burnishing, and the addition of details as needed; the surface color may also be enhanced with inlays, coating, plating, and/or patination.
