Diagram depicting a type of inversion casting: 1) core pins are inserted into a hollow wax model; 2) the sprue system is fused onto the wax model; 3) the wax model is covered in a refractory investment material; 4) the mold is then heated until dry and all traces of the wax melted and burned out; 5) meanwhile, a simple receptacle that will serve as a crucible is shaped of refractory material; small pieces of bronze and charcoal are placed in the crucible, which is luted to the mold to form an enclosed unit; 6) the mold-crucible is heated until the metal is molten; 7) the mold with its integral crucible is then inverted to allow the liquefied bronze to pour quickly into the mold; the charcoal helps to reduce oxidation; 8) fettling includes breaking off the refractory mold, removing the core pins, and cutting away the sprue system; 9) chasing may consist of polishing, burnishing, and the addition of details as needed; the surface color may also be enhanced with inlays, coating, plating, and/or patination.
