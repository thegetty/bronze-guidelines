Detail of a cast-on repair in the center of a relief panel that has been set into the side of a Renaissance pedestal on which a Hellenistic bronze is mounted (yellow overlay). Also in yellow, the lower image shows the back side of the cast-on repair. The sprues, including a vent and a gate, were left in place and not removed (blue arrows). The repair was made with the relief face-down before being mounted to the pedestal. *Idolino* (Ephebe from Pesaro), ca. 30 BCE, base by the workshop of Girolamo (Italian, ca. 1510–1584/89), Aurelio, and Ludovico (Italian, 1507/8–1575) Lombardo, perhaps after a drawing by Sebastiano Serlio (Italian, 1475–1544), 1530–38/40, H. 148 cm (300 cm with base) (Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Florence, inv. 1637).
