Diagram of generations of casts (here through the lost-wax process): a) the original model here is in clay, but could be made of any material; b) the translation of the original model into a wax inter-model may involve more than simple molding; c) a close reproduction of the original model will be referred to as a replica (a wax inter-model that is altered in details and with additional features (e.g., a base) will result in a variant); d) more alterations can be made after casting (e.g., with a base or a different patina); e) a bronze can in turn serve as model for another generation of casts by taking a mold of it; f) because wax shrinks as it cools, the inter-models are slightly smaller than the bronze model and their details softer unless reworked; g) the bronze after-cast may in turn be reworked and finished differently than its original bronze model or sister casts.
