Two examples of radiocarbon dating results generated using OxCal 4.4 software (see {% cite 'Bronk Ramsey 2009' %}). The radiocarbon determination is represented, along with its uncertainty, as the red curve along the vertical axis; the narrower the curve, the more precise was the instrumental measurement. The blue band represents the IntCal20 calibration curve, which accounts for minor variability in carbon-14 concentration in the atmosphere over time (see {% cite 'Reimer et al. 2020' %}). The gray curves along the horizontal axis (calibrated date) represent the probability that the sample actually originated at any given time; the higher the curve, the greater the probability that the date below is correct. The brackets below the gray curves show the time period that is 95.4% certain to contain the true age. Depending on the precision of the measurement and the shape of the calibration curve, a radiocarbon analysis can yield results of varying precision, and can even yield results with more than one possible date range.
