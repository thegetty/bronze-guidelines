Radiographic detail of the torso of Apollo clearly shows a wax-to-wax joint as a dark ellipse at the junction of the arm to the shoulder (blue). See also the complex armature and notably the transverse rods (orange) going through the main armature rods (red). *Apollo and Daphne*, probably France, early 18th century, H. 85 cm (Mus√©e Fabre, Montpellier, France, inv. 836.4.86).
