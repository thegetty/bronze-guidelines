Profile of an engraving made in the metal on the front piece of the cloth of the *Statuette of Jambhala*, as measured by digital microscopy. The vertical axis reports the depth and the horizontal axis the width of the engraving (both in µm). The surface of the bronze is represented by the horizontal green dotted line. The cross section of the engraving and its dimensions are represented by the red curve. The maximum depth appears to be ~0.6 mm (600 µm), and the width at the surface is ~2 mm (2000 µm). See the altered V shape of the imprint (blue arrow), which demonstrates that the engraving in the metal was made by following a line already in the wax model. *Statuette of Jambhala*, central Java, first half of the 9th century, H. 28 cm (Musée national des arts asiatiques – Guimet, Paris, inv. MG 3814). See {% cite 'Mechling et al. 2018' %}.
