Backscattered electron micrograph of a polished cross section showing the dendritic microstructure and grains of the primary cast of an experimental sample aimed to investigate fusion welding (E54, binary bronze CuSn10). The outlines of dendrites appear dark gray; the interdendritic space is filled with phase alfa + delta (eutectoïd composition) (light gray).
