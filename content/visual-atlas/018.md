Main steps of the indirect wax slab process: 1) a piece mold is formed on the model, composed of smaller pieces to account for the undercuts; 2) the piece mold is removed and sections are lined with thin, warmed sheets (slabs) of wax; 3) the wax parts are joined with a hot tool to form a hollow inter-model, and the surface is reworked as needed; 4) the hollow wax inter-model is Ô¨Ålled with refractory core material and core pins are inserted through the wax and into the core; 5) the wax sprue system is fused to the inter-model in strategic locations with a hot tool; 6) the inter-model is invested in a refractory mold; 7) the mold is then heated until dry and all traces of the wax burned out; 8) molten bronze is poured into the mold; 9) fettling includes breaking off the refractory mold, removing the core pins, and cutting away the sprue system. Chasing may include polishing, burnishing, and the addition of details as needed; the surface color may also be enhanced with inlays, plating, and/or a patina.
