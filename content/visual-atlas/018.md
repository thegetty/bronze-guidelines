Main steps of the indirect wax slab process: 

{% ref fig='fig-018' text='1)' region='410,300,1660,1550' %} a piece mold is formed on the model, composed of smaller pieces to account for the undercuts; 

{% ref fig='fig-018' text='2)' region='2370,300,1660,1550' %} the piece mold is removed and sections are lined with thin, warmed sheets (slabs) of wax; 

{% ref fig='fig-018' text='3)' region='4340,300,1480,1550' %} the wax parts are joined with a hot tool to form a hollow inter-model, and the surface is reworked as needed; 

{% ref fig='fig-018' text='4)' region='410,2140,1450,1550' %} the hollow wax inter-model is Ô¨Ålled with refractory core material and core pins are inserted through the wax and into the core; 

{% ref fig='fig-018' text='5)' region='2420,2140,1450,1550' %} the wax sprue system is fused to the inter-model in strategic locations with a hot tool; 

{% ref fig='fig-018' text='6)' region='4360,2140,1450,1550' %} the inter-model is invested in a refractory mold; 

{% ref fig='fig-018' text='7)' region='410,4390,1450,1550' %} the mold is then heated until dry and all traces of the wax burned out; 

{% ref fig='fig-018' text='8)' region='2380,3930,1450,2010' %} molten bronze is poured into the mold; 

{% ref fig='fig-018' text='9)' region='4340,4390,1450,1550' %} fettling includes breaking off the refractory mold, removing the core pins, and cutting away the sprue system. Chasing may include polishing, burnishing, and the addition of details as needed; the surface color may also be enhanced with inlays, plating, and/or a patina.
