Tool marks testifying to the cutting back of the core. Shown here is the back view of a bronze fragment of the Vendôme Column. This may be related to what the founder of most of the Vendôme Column bronzes, Jean-Baptiste Launay (French, 1768–1827), described as *amaigrissement du noyau* (core thinning). Various French sculptors, *Vendôme Column*, 1805–10, dismantled 1871, re-erected 1873–75, H. 44 m (Place Vendôme, Paris). See {% cite 'Launay 1827' %}, 1:xv.
