Diagrams of two types of common metallographic microstructures of copper alloys. Left: in the dendritic microstructure characteristic of a cast alloy, the dendrites are enclosed by the boundaries of forming grains; right: in the fully recrystallized microstructure, the hexagonal grains are equiaxed. From {% cite 'Scott 1991' %}, 7, figs. 11a and 11c.
