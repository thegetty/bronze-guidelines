Detail of the inside of the bronze showing a core pin hole (diameter 2.5 mm) made in the wax inter-model. The softened rim of the hole was created as the warmed core pin was pushed through the wax. Brush marks and fingerprints are further evidence of the production of the wax inter-model. Andrew Lacey (British, b. 1969), *Ashen*, 2021, H. 192 cm (artistâ€™s collection).
