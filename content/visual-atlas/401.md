Annotated neutron radiograph of frontal view, showing more clearly than the X-radiograph ([fig. 400](/visual-atlas/#fig-400){target=_blank}) the contours of the sealing material (red overlay) and some of the consecration offerings (purple, red, and green overlays). For an even better visualization of the consecration offerings (in another statuette), refer to the tomographic images in [figs. 403](/visual-atlas/#fig-403){target=_blank}, [404](/visual-atlas/#fig-404){target=_blank}. Kubera/Jambhala, Java, first half of the 10th century, H. 18 cm (Musée national des arts asiatiques – Guimet, Paris, inv. MG 3625). See %%Mechling et al. 2018%%.
