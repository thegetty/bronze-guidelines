Example of geometric morphometric analysis on Iron Age iron lances. The various shapes of lances are superimposed using a specific protocol called generalized procrustes analysis (upper image). In the lower image, each point represents a normalized measure, for a given lance, at a predefined location or “landmark.” See {% cite 'Birch and Martinón-Torres 2019' %}, fig. 9.
