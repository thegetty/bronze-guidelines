The separately cast cape secures to the proper right shoulder with a dovetail joint. The nearly identical alloys of the figure and the cape suggest that they were cast at the same time. After Willem Danielsz. van Tetrode (Dutch, ca. 1525–1580), *Warrior on Horseback*, 1562–65, H. 39.7 cm (J. Paul Getty Museum, inv. 85.SB.90).
