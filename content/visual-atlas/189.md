Detail of a weld repair. In the photograph, the surface porosity indicates the location of the weld line on the carefully chased and polished surface; note that the color along the weld does not vary from that of the adjacent surfaces. The X-radiograph (right) reveals the uneven line of excess welding metal that remains on the interior along the join. Joan Mirò (Spanish, 1893–1983), *Personnage*, designed 1976, cast 1985, H. 213.4 cm (J. Paul Getty Museum, inv. 2005.116).
