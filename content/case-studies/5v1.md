## Introduction

</div>

The Monument of the Heart of Duke Anne de Montmorency (1493-1567), Constable of France commissioned in 1571 includes three life-size bronze statues. These were made by two sculptors, Barthélémy Prieur and Martin Lefort. In the archives, only one founder, Nicolas Péron, is associated with the casting of two of the statues. A technical investigation of the statues, including metal and core analysis and visual and radiographic examinations, was undertaken to discern whether all three statues might have been cast by Péron and to shed light on the relationship between sculptors and founder(s), crucial in this period of Renaissance bronze statuary.

## The Commission

Bullant charged two sculptors to produce the statues. Barthélémy Prieur (1536-1611) was responsible for the figures of *Abundance* and *Peace.* Martin Le Fort (known to have been active between 1562-1582) made that of *Justice*. The founder Nicolas Péron was commissioned to cast the two statues by Prieur. There is no record of who cast the third.

## Main Questions

- Can the physical evidence help clarify who was ultimately in charge of the production, and whether they were all cast by the same founder?

- Can comparison of the casting process used for each of the statues help answer these questions?

- And likewise, what can the characterization and comparison of the materials used tell us with regard to these questions?

## Visual evidence of lost wax casting

Clear traces of working in the wax can be found, for instance, in the modeling of details such as the vine leaf and grapes held by Abundance. It is also clear from the examination of the underside of all three sculptures, which are hollow casts with relatively thick, uneven metal walls, still partially filled with the baked, sandy clay cores that were built around a system of iron armature rods, as seen here in the interior of *Peace*.

## Internal evidence of unique chaplets

</div>

The location of core supports is nearly invisible on the radiographs. Endoscopic examination of the interior metal walls of the Justice and the Peace where the core has been removed revealed a rather unique feature in both: the raised outline of what looks like a rectangular bronze patch with an integral faceted tapering point extending out from their center. That these features are idiosyncratic to these 2 casts is a strong indication of their production in the same foundry. No such chaplets could be observed in the radiographs of the Abundance due to the possible masking of the internal surface by the core.

{{< q-slide-fp "Direct Cast?" >}}

## A direct lost wax cast?

Radiography of the statues shows the relatively thick metal walls and the shape of the preserved vestiges of the original armatures. Few wax-to-wax joints are visible, and the internal surfaces do not conform to external contours. The latter features suggested that the sculptures were directly cast.

## Armature system

The armature systems were mapped out based on the radiographs for each sculpture, to the extent possible. The gauge of iron rods seems similar in all three. Both of Prieur's figures show that the core of the protruding arms was bound with wires. The Le Fort figure does not have these, probably because the core was almost entirely removed.

{{< q-slide-fp "Lasagna" >}}

## The archives point to an indirect process: Lasagna

The surviving contract between Prieur and Peron, however, mentions that the founder produce the wax model from a plaster piece mold that the sculptor had made of his original model. All of the evidence now points to some version of the lasagna technique described by Benvenuto Cellini.

{{< q-slide-fp "Core" >}}

## A characteristic core composition?

Some core could be sampled from underneath of each statue. A new methodology based on the precise measurement of the size of the quarts inclusions in the clay core of bronze statues has allowed to show that the cores of the 3 allegories were not only the same, but very specific with respect to 16^th^ and 17^th^-century Parisian bronzes analyzed to date. Indeed, whereas the petrographic images do not show much differences, the distribution of sizes of quartz inclusions show slight but clear differences. Whereas in most 16^th^-17^th^-century Parisian bronzes, 2 sizes of inclusions coexist (very small inclusions of around 5 µm and much larger ones -- 150µm), in the allegories only the large inclusions are present (100-200µm).

{{< q-slide-fp "Alloys" >}}

## The alloys

ICP-AES analysis of a sample drilled from each statue revealed that Prieur's *Abundance* and *Peace* are made of tin-bronze, whereas Le Fort's *Justice* is made of brass. Moreover, the very different impurity patterns suggest disparate copper ore sources. If Péron cast all three sculptures, he would have been responsible for preparing and pouring the metal. How then to explain the variation in the alloy types?

## Summary of findings -- a unique founder?

The three figures were cast by a similar method using idiosyncratic chaplets, and a similar core composition, which strongly suggests that they were cast by the same founder.

The variation in metal composition would suggest, however, that a different founder was involved. All of Prieur's large bronzes cast in France we know of are made of tin --bronze. It is possible that he imposed his choice of alloy on the founder. Conversely, Martin Le Fort was of less renown with no documented previous experience in casting, he might have left it up to Péron to work with his preferred alloy, which we assume was brass (this of course is only an hypothesis, we unfortunately have no record of other productions of Nicolas Péron to discuss this point). "

In the end, the sculptors' different backgrounds and status allows us to rationalize that the alloy used for Prieur's two figures was due to the artist's deliberate Italianate choice, and that the founder Péron was willing and able to successfully execute the casts for the monument in both alloys.

## Synopsis of technical parameters

The study was integrally carried out at the C2RMF as a public service to French museums. The total duration of the study was more than 100 person-days, as part of Manon Castelle PhD.

- *Visual examinations*: Manon Castelle & D Bourgarit (C2RMF), F Bewer (Straus...)

- *Day-light photography*: Dominique Bagault (C2RMF)

- *X-ray Radiography*; Thierry Borel and Jean Marsac(C2RMF). Note that the particularly large thickness of the metal wall and the core filling created a very dense barrier that pushed the X-ray facilities of the C2RMF to their limit.

- *Endoscopy*: Manon Castelle (C2RMF).

- *Bulk metal analyses by Atomic Emission spectrometry (ICP-AES)*: Nathalie Gandolfo, Jessica Legendre, B Mille, D Bourgarit (C2RMF)

- *Core analysis*: M Castelle & Yvan Coquinot (C2RMF).

For more on the operating conditions see Castelle 2016 & 2019, and Seelig 2014.

## Further questions

- What was the original patina of the statues? Was it the same for all three?

- What was Nicolas Peron's training and production prior to the casting of the allegories?

- With such information, it might provide insight into his alloy preference and approach to casting sculpture.
