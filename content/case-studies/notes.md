**Notes:**

- Includes a series of object images laid out on a timeline
- Most of the main slides are at this point just headings and images, there's less narrative here
- The images include details, x-rays, RTI, and digital microcopy
- Includes a scatterplot and bar charts. One of the bar charts is like the timeline and includes object images across it
- There's a map with object images overlaid as well
