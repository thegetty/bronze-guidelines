## Introduction

(fig. 523){.pdf-figure-list}

Commissioned in 1571, the Monument of the Heart of Duke Anne de Montmorency (French, 1493–1567), Constable of France, includes three {% def "bronze" %} statues. These were made by two sculptors, Barthélémy Prieur (French, 1536–1611) and Martin Lefort (French, active 1562–82). In the archives, only one {% def "founder" %}, Nicolas Péron, is associated with the casting of two of the statues. A technical investigation of the statues, including metal and {% def "core" %} analysis and visual and radiographic examinations, was undertaken to discern whether Péron might have {% def "cast (v.)" "cast" %} all three and to shed light on the relationship between the sculptors and the founder(s), which was crucial in this period of Renaissance bronze statuary.

## The commission

In 1571, Madeleine of Savoy, Anne de Montmorency’s wife, commissioned the architect Jean Bullant (French, 1515–1578) to produce a funerary monument for the heart of her husband. The monument, now in the Louvre, is composed of a sculpted stone column that would originally have been topped by an urn containing the heart. Bronze allegorical personifications of Abundance, Peace, and Justice were situated around the base of the column as witnesses to the character of the deceased. Bullant charged two sculptors to produce the statues. Prieur was responsible for Abundance and Peace, and Lefort made Justice. Péron was commissioned to cast the statues by Prieur. There is no record of who cast Lefort’s.

## The main questions

(figs. 34, 97, 524){.pdf-figure-list}

- Considering the number of people who collaborated in the production of such sculptures (and there were no doubt more unnamed hands involved as well), can the physical evidence help clarify who was ultimately in charge of the production? 

- Does the technical evidence suggest that the same founder or different ones worked with the two sculptors to cast the three sculptures? 

- Can comparison of the casting processes used for each of the statues help answer these questions? 

- What can the characterization and comparison of the materials used tell us with regard to these questions?

## Visual evidence of lost-wax casting

(figs. 8, 51, 70){.pdf-figure-list}

Clear traces of {% def "lost-wax casting" %} can be found in the modeling of details such as the vine leaf and cornucopia held by Abundance. They reproduce the malleable quality of the original model’s material.

<section class="slide ref" data-figure-id="fig-008" data-region="" data-annotation-ids="brick-a" data-on-scroll="true">

It is also clear from an examination of the inside of the sculptures that all three are hollow {% def "cast (n.)" "casts" %} with relatively thick, uneven metal walls, still partially filled with the baked, sandy clay cores that were built around a system of iron {% def "armature" %} rods, as seen here in the interior of Peace.

<section class="slide ref" data-figure-id="fig-038" data-region="" data-annotation-ids="" data-on-scroll="true">

## Internal evidence of unique chaplets

(fig. 38){.pdf-figure-list}

The location of {% def "core supports" %} is nearly invisible on the radiographs. Endoscopic examination of the interior metal walls of Justice and Peace where the core had been removed revealed a rather unique feature in both: the raised outline of what looks like a rectangular bronze {% def "patch" %} with an integral faceted tapering point extending out from its center. No such {% def "chaplets" %} were found in any other large contemporary Parisian bronzes. That these features are idiosyncratic to these two casts is a strong indication of their production in the same foundry. Whether the Abundance has them can’t be verified as the statue is still largely filled with core.

## A direct lost-wax cast?

(figs. 13, 34, 97, 524){.pdf-figure-list}

Radiography of the statues showed the relatively thick metal walls and the shape of the preserved vestiges of the original armatures. Few wax-to-wax joints are visible, and the internal surfaces do not conform to external contours. The latter features further support the hypothesis that the sculptures were directly cast.

## Armature system

(figs. 34, 97, 524){.pdf-figure-list}

The armature systems were mapped out based on the radiographs for each sculpture, to the extent possible. The gauge of iron rods seems similar in all three. Both of Prieur’s figures show that the core of the protruding arms was bound with wires. The Lefort figure does not have these, probably because the core was almost entirely removed.

## Conflicting archival evidence

(fig. 23){.pdf-figure-list}

It was a surprise to find out from the surviving contract between Prieur and Peron that the founder was to produce the wax {% def "model" %} from a plaster {% def "piece mold" %} that the sculptor had made of his original model. All of the evidence forced us to reassess our interpretation and points to some version of the lasagna technique described by Benvenuto Cellini, the Florentine goldsmith and sculptor who was active at the French court around this time (Italian, 1500–1571; see [GI§2.3.2](/intro/#s2-3-2)).

## A characteristic core composition?

(figs. 23, 274, 405, 406, 427, 428, 525, 526, 527){.pdf-figure-list}

Some core could be sampled from underneath each statue. A new methodology based on the precise measurement of the size of the quartz inclusions showed that the cores of the three allegories were not only the same, but very specific with respect to sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Parisian bronzes analyzed to date.

<section class="slide ref" data-figure-id="fig-427-428-525-group" data-region=""  data-annotation-ids="" data-on-scroll="true">

Indeed, whereas in most sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Parisian bronzes, <span class="is-screen-only">some of which are represented below, </span>two sizes of inclusions coexist (very small inclusions of around 5 µm in diameter and much larger ones, up to 150 µm in diameter), in the allegories only large inclusions are present (100–200 µm).

## The alloys

(fig. 528){.pdf-figure-list}

Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy analysis (ICP-AES; see [II.5§3.1](/vol-2/5/#s3-1)) of a sample drilled from each statue revealed that Prieur’s Abundance and Peace are made of tin-bronze, whereas Lefort’s Justice is made of {% def "brass" %}. Moreover, the very different impurity patterns suggest disparate copper ore sources. If Péron cast all three sculptures, he would have been responsible for preparing and {% def "pouring" %} the metal. How then to explain the variation in the alloy types?

## Summary of findings

### A unique founder?

(figs. 034, 097, 524){.pdf-figure-list}

The three figures were cast by a similar method using idiosyncratic chaplets and a similar core composition, which strongly suggests that they were cast by the same founder. The variation in metal composition would suggest, however, that a different founder may have been involved. All of Prieur’s large bronzes that were cast in France are made of tin-bronze. It is possible that he imposed his choice of alloy on the founder. Conversely, Lefort was of less renown, with no documented previous experience in casting, and so he might have left it up to Péron to work with his preferred alloy, which we assume was brass (this of course is only a hypothesis; we unfortunately have no record of other productions by Péron).

In the end, the sculptors’ different backgrounds and status led us to speculate that the choice of bronze alloy adopted for Prieur’s two figures may have been linked to the artist's exposure to practices he encountered in Italy, and that the founder Péron was willing and able to successfully execute the casts for the monument in both alloys.

## Synopsis of technical parameters {#synopsis}

The study was carried out at the C2RMF as a public service to French museums, and the procedures undertaken by staff unless indicated. Its total duration was more than one hundred person-days, as part of Manon Castelle’s PhD research. The study consisted of:

- visual examination: Manon Castelle, David Bourgarit, and Francesca G. Bewer (Harvard Art Museums). This was one of the most time-consuming steps in the study.

- daylight photography: Dominique Bagault and Anne Maigret. Of the circa 100 photos taken per statue, about half were selected.

- X-radiography: Thierry Borel, Jean Marsac, and Elsa Lambert. The particularly large thickness of the metal wall and the core filling created a very dense barrier that pushed the X-ray facilities of the C2RMF to their limit.

- endoscopy: Manon Castelle.

- bulk metal analyses by atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES): Nathalie Gandolfo, Jessica Legendre, Benoit Mille, and David Bourgarit.

- core analysis: Manon Castelle and Yvan Coquinot. In the framework of Castelle’s PhD work, this study offered the opportunity to develop a new protocol detailed in [II.7§2.2.4](/vol-2/7/#s2-2-4).

## Further questions

- What was the original {% def "patina" %} of the statues? Was it the same for all three?

- What was Péron’s training and production prior to the casting of the allegories? Such information might provide insight into his alloy preference and approach to casting sculpture.
