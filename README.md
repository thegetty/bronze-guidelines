## Using the 11ty Version

1. Clone this repository and select the appropriate branch.

2. In Terminal, make sure you are using Node 16.15.0 or higher, with `node --version`. (See section on NVM below.)

3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies. This just needs to be done once when first cloning the project, or whenever the core template/code files are updated.

4. Enter the following command to add the preview URL to your environment variables. This is hopefully temporary, but currently required because of the way IIIF images are set up. Doing so with `export URL=http://localhost:8080` adds it just for the current session. This will need to be repeated each time you close and reopen your command-line shell. Or you can add it to your .bash-profile to make it persist.

    ```
    export URL=http://localhost:8080
    ```

5. See the preview with `npm run dev`. I find it needs to be stopped and restarted often to get it to refresh changes, especially with YAML.

## Using NVM to Manage Different Node Verisons

The full instructions are here: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm. But this condensed version should cover the basics.

1. Install the script with the following command:

    ```
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
    ```

2. Verify with this command, which should return `nvm`. If it does not, see the Troubleshooting info at https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#troubleshooting-on-macos.

    ```
    command -v nvm
    ```

3. Install the versions of node you want to use:

    ```
    nvm install 14.18.1
    ```

    ```
    nvm install 16.15.0
    ```

4. Optionally, set a default version to use with `nvm alias default 14.18.1` or `nvm alias default 16.15.0`. This default will be the one used every time you open a new Terminal window.

5. To choose/change a Node version to run use `nvm use 14` or `nvm use 16`. This will be the version used for as long as that Terminal window is open, or until you change it again.

## Creating a PDF Version

1. Build the current site: `npm run build`

2. Move needed files (which Vite is otherwise removing) into the _site directory: `rm -r _site/_assets/images/figures && cp -r content/_assets/images/figures _site/_assets/images/figures && cp public/pdf.html _site && cp public/pdf.css _site`

3. Fix the font paths: Open _site/pdf.css, find `/_assets/fonts/` and replace with `_assets/fonts/`

4. Output the PDF: `npm run build:prince`
