## Using the 11ty Version

1. Clone this repository and select the appropriate branch.

2. In Terminal, make sure you are using Node 18.12.1, with `node --version`. (See section on NVM below.) And Quire 1.0.0-rc.0 with `quire --version`.

3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies. This just needs to be done once when first cloning the project, or whenever the core template/code files are updated.

4. See the preview with `quire preview`. I find it needs to be stopped and restarted often to get it to refresh changes, especially with YAML.

## Using NVM to Manage Different Node Verisons

The full instructions are here: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm. But this condensed version should cover the basics.

1. Install the script with the following command:

    ```
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
    ```

2. Verify with this command, which should return `nvm`. If it does not, see the Troubleshooting info at https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#troubleshooting-on-macos.

    ```
    command -v nvm
    ```

3. Install the versions of node you want to use:

    ```
    nvm install 14.18.1
    ```

    ```
    nvm install 16.15.0
    ```

4. Optionally, set a default version to use with `nvm alias default 14.18.1` or `nvm alias default 16.15.0`. This default will be the one used every time you open a new Terminal window.

5. To choose/change a Node version to run use `nvm use 14` or `nvm use 16`. This will be the version used for as long as that Terminal window is open, or until you change it again.

## Build and Deploy the HTML Version

1. Set publication.url to https://www.getty.edu/publications/bronze-guidelines/

2. Run `quire build`

3. In `_site` find all instances of `src=\"/_assets/images/` and replace with `src=\"/publications/bronze-guidelines/_assets/images/`

4. Run `netlify deploy`

## Creating a PDF Version

1. Build the current site: `npm run build`

2. Move needed files (which Vite is otherwise removing) into the _site directory: `rm -r _site/_assets/images/figures && cp -r content/_assets/images/figures _site/_assets/images/figures && cp public/pdf.html _site && cp public/pdf.css _site`

3. Fix the font paths: Open _site/pdf.css, find `/_assets/fonts/` and replace with `_assets/fonts/`

4. Output the PDF: `npm run build:prince`

## Editorial Production Notes

While it is a core principle of Quire for all content to only exist in one place in the Markdown and YAML files (chapter titles in the chapter Markdown file, references in `references.yaml`, etc.), a number of technical hurdles with this publication necessitated some duplication of content in a number of areas. They are documented here. Care should be taken that any changes should be made in **all** content locations.

- **Figure Captions**: Figure captions now exist both in the `figures.yaml` file as usual, and on the individual figure Markdown pages in the Visual Atlas (`/visual-atlas/`) section. Those in `figures.yaml` are used in the PDF and EPUB outputs and do not include any shortcode markup (instead of `{% cite 'Bourgarit 2019' %}` it is just "Bourgarit 2019"); those in the Visual Atlas are used online exclusively and include both `cite` and `ref` shortcodes.

- Definitions: Definitions for the Vocabulary section are stored as YAML on on each page so that they can be accessed with the `def` shortcode. However, they also need to appear on the pages themselves. They include shortcodes though and we were unable to process those from where the definitions were stored in YAML. For these pages, the definition exists in the YAML of the page, and in the Markdown section just below. Pages with this duplication have been marked `definition_has_shortcodes: true` for ready identification, though they are a majority of the Vocabulary pages.
