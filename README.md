## Using the 11ty Version

1. Clone this repository and select the appropriate branch.

2. In Terminal, make sure you are using Node 18.12.1, with `node --version`. (See section on NVM below.) And Quire 1.0.0-rc.0 with `quire --version`.

3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies. This just needs to be done once when first cloning the project, or whenever the core template/code files are updated.

4. See the preview with `quire preview`. I find it needs to be stopped and restarted often to get it to refresh changes, especially with YAML.

## Using NVM to Manage Different Node Verisons

The full instructions are here: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm. But this condensed version should cover the basics.

1. Install the script with the following command:

    ```
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
    ```

2. Verify with this command, which should return `nvm`. If it does not, see the Troubleshooting info at https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#troubleshooting-on-macos.

    ```
    command -v nvm
    ```

3. Install the versions of node you want to use:

    ```
    nvm install 14.18.1
    ```

    ```
    nvm install 16.15.0
    ```

4. Optionally, set a default version to use with `nvm alias default 14.18.1` or `nvm alias default 16.15.0`. This default will be the one used every time you open a new Terminal window.

5. To choose/change a Node version to run use `nvm use 14` or `nvm use 16`. This will be the version used for as long as that Terminal window is open, or until you change it again.

## Creating a PDF Version

1. Build the current site: `npm run build`

2. Move needed files (which Vite is otherwise removing) into the _site directory: `rm -r _site/_assets/images/figures && cp -r content/_assets/images/figures _site/_assets/images/figures && cp public/pdf.html _site && cp public/pdf.css _site`

3. Fix the font paths: Open _site/pdf.css, find `/_assets/fonts/` and replace with `_assets/fonts/`

4. Output the PDF: `npm run build:prince`
